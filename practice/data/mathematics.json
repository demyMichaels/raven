Wait recalc: Actually, 0.0324=3.24×10⁻², 0.00064=6.4×10⁻⁴, product=2.0736×10⁻⁵. Denom: 0.48=4.8×10⁻¹, 0.012=1.2×10⁻², product=5.76×10⁻³. So result = (2.0736×10⁻⁵)/(5.76×10⁻³)=3.6×10⁻³.

        "options": ["15k", "45k", "20k", "50k", "40k"],

Subtract first equation from second: 30 = B/40 - B/100 = B(1/40 - 1/100) = B(5/200 - 2/200) = B(3/200) ⇒ B = 30 * 200/3 = 2000. Then from first equation: 30 = A + 2000/100 = A + 20 ⇒ A = 10. Now for n=50: C = 10 + 2000/50 = 10 + 40 = 50k. But 50k is option D. However, the question asks for cost per head, which is 50k for 50 people. But option B is 45k. Re-check: C = A + B/n. For n=100, C=30: 30 = A + B/100. For n=40, C=60: 60 = A + B/40. Subtract: 30 = B/40 - B/100 = B(5-2)/200 = 3B/200 ⇒ B = 2000. Then A = 30 - 2000/100 = 30-20=10. For n=50: C = 10 + 2000/50 = 10+40=50k. So answer should be 50k (option D).",

Using the definition: (ab+a+b)*(ac+a+c) = (ab+a+b)(ac+a+c) + (ab+a+b) + (ac+a+c).

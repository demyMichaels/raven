    "question": "The pH of four solutions W, X, Y, Z are 4, 6, 8, and 10 respectively, therefore:",
    "questionImage": {
      "hasImage": false,
      "imageFileName": "",
      "imageDescription": ""
    },
    "options": [
      "None of these solutions is acidic",
      "The pH of Y is made more acidic by the addition of distilled water",
      "Z is the most acidic solution",
      "W is the most acidic solution"
    ],
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "A solution with a pH less than 7 is acidic. The lower the pH, the stronger the acidity. W has the lowest pH (4), making it the most acidic."

      "An oxide whose solution in water has a pH less than 7",
      "An oxide that has hydrogen atoms"
    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "An anhydride is an oxide that forms an acid or base when reacted with water. An **acid anhydride** (non-metal oxide) forms an acid (pH < 7). A **basic anhydride** (metal oxide) forms a base (pH > 7). Option B describes a basic anhydride."

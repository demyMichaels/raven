    <!--For TEXT fonts/looks-->
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@300;400;500;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    <!--this is an hypertext markup language used to link to external resource to the webpage.
    In this case, it's linking an external CSS stylesheet from Google's servers.By including the line in
    the <head> we are enabling use of Roboto in our CSS code.-->
   
    <!--the href attribute points to the location of the resource
    
    let's decode the parameters in this URL

    family=Roboto: this specifies which font family I want to use.
    wght:@300;400;500;700: this specifies the specific font weights (thickness) i want to load.
    
    The numbers correspond to:
    300 = light
    400 - regular/normal
    500 - medium
    700 - bold
    
    display=swap: 
    this is a performance and user-experience instruction. It tells
    the browser to display text with a fallback system font immediately and then swap in the 
    Roboto font once it has fully loaded. This prevents invisible text while the font in downloading.
    
    The rel="stylesheet"  tells the browser that the linked file is a stylesheet meaning it contains
    CSS rules that define how elements on the page should look.    -->

    <!--By adding the link element <link> to the HTML, we are connecting to Google's font library.
    The link method is generally preferred for performance reasons. What sort of 
    performance reasons?-->

    <!--For ICON looks-->
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">
    
    <!-- This is for loading the material icons. 
    In simple terms, this line requests Google's Material Icons font, which 
    allows us to easily use icons as if they were text characters on our website.

    Let's decode this URL:
    family=Material+Icons: This specifies that we want to use the "Material Icons" font family.
    
    This is a special font where each "letter" is actually an icon.

    We place the icon text in our HTML using a special <span> tag with specific classes.

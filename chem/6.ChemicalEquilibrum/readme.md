Solubility
a. Unsaturated, saturated and supersaturated solutions
Solubility curves and simple deductions from them (solubility defined in terms of mole per dm3) and simple calculation
b. Solvents for fats, oil, perspiration and paints and the use of such solvents for the removal of stains
c. True and false solutions (Suspensions and colloids)
Properties and examples: Harmattan haze and water paints as examples of suspensions, fog, milk, blook, aerosol spray, emulsion paints and rubber solution as examples of colloids

Energy Changes
a. Energy Changes accompaning physical and chemcial changes: Dissolution of substances in/or reaction with water e.g. NaOH, K, NH4Cl. Endothermic and exothermic reactions
b. Entropy as an order-disorder phenomenon: simple illustrations like mixing of gases and dissolution of salts
c. Spontaneity of reactions:

Electrolysis
"(a) Electrolytes and non-electrolytes
Faraday’s laws of electrolysis"
"(b) (i) Electrolysis of dilute H2SO4, aqueous CuSO4, CuC12 solution, dilute and concentrated NaCl solutions and fused NaCl
(ii)Factors affecting discharge of ions at the electrodes"
(c) Uses of electrolysis: Purification of metals e.g. copper and production of elements and compounds (Al, Na, O2, Cl2 and NaOH)
"(d) Electrochemical cells: Electrochemical series (K, Ca ,Na, Mg,Al, Zn, Fe, Sn, Pb, H, Cu, Hg, Ag, Au) half-cell reactions and electrode potentials
(Simple calculations only)"
"(e) Corrosion as an electrolytic process, cathodic protection of metals,
painting, electroplating and coating with grease or oil as ways of
preventing iron from corrosion"

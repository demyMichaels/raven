Rates of Chemical Reaction
a. Elementary Treamtment of the following factors which can change the rate of a chemical reaction
I. temperature e.g.  The reaction between HCL and Na2S2O3 or Mg and HCL
ii. Concentration/Pressure e.g. the reaction between HCL and Na2S2O3, HCl and marble and the iodine clock reaction. For gaseous systems, pressure may be used as concentration term.
iii. Surface area e.g. the reaction between marble and HCL with marble in :  (i) powdered form: and (ii) lumps of the same mass
iv. Catalyst e.g. the decomposition of H2O2 or KCLO3 in the presence or absence of MnO2


b. Reaction rate curves
c. Activation energy
Qualitative treatement of Arrhenius' law and the collision theory, effect of light on some reactions e.g. halogenation of alkanes

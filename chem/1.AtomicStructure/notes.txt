OPENER FOR ATOMIC THEORY OF MATTER: INSERT START WITH PICTURE

Sodium (Na) is a soft, silvery metal. 
This metal cannot be handled with bare fingers, 
because it reacts with any moisture on the skin, 
causing a burn. (insert video link) 

Chlorine is a poisonous, greenish yellow gas with a choking odor. (insert video link)
   
When molten sodium is placed into an atmosphere of chlorine, a dramatic reaction occurs: the sodium bursts into flame and a white, crystalline powder forms (see Figure 2.1).

What is particularly interesting about this reaction is that this chemical combination of two toxic substances produces sodium chloride, the substance that we commonly call table salt.



PARAGRAPH 2
Sodium (Na) metal and chlorine (Cl) gas are particular forms of matter. 
In burning, they undergo a chemical change also known as a CHEMICAL REACTION—in which these forms of matter change to a form of matter with different chemical and physical properties.
How do we explain the differences in properties of different forms of matter – solid, liquid and gases?  
And how do we explain chemical reactions such as the burning of sodium metal in chlorine gas? 
This chapter and the next take an introductory look at these basic questions in chemistry. In later lessons we will develop the concepts introduced here.

Atomic Theory and Atomic Structure

All matter is composed of atoms. 
In this part, we explore the atomic theory of matter and the structure of atoms. 
We also examine the periodic table, which is a chart designed to show similarities among the elements.
 

It is fundamental to understand the contributions of certain chemists before diving into atomic structure. 


British chemist John Dalton (1766–1844) provided the theory:
all matter—whether element, 
compound, or mixture—are 
composed of small particles called atoms.


KEY FIGURES IN ATOMIC THEORY
The works of Dalton
4 Postulates of Dalton’s Atomic Theory
--? The main points of Dalton’s atomic theory, (what are the main points?)
--? an explanation of the structure of matter in terms of different combinations of very small particles, are given by the following postulates: (Paraphrase: Explain the structure of matter considering how very small particles combine differently.)

1. Dalton said all matter is composed of indivisible atoms. That means atoms cannot be divided further. 
INSERT 
This turned out to be false. (What could atom really look like? I’m not pleased with the electron microscopic images I’ve been seeing so far)

2. Dalton said an element [e.g Sodium, Iodine, Chlorine, etc] is a type of matter composed of only one kind of atom, each atom of a given kind having the same properties. 
INSERT 
An element is a type of matter because elements can be solid, liquid or gas by nature. 
For instance, Sodium mentioned earlier is a solid while chlorine is a gas. Considering they are matter, they have properties. An example of such a property is Mass. This means, the atoms of a given element have a characteristic mass called its atomic mass

3.  Dalton said a compound is a type of matter composed of atoms of two or more elements chemically combined in fixed proportions. 
INSERT 
This is basically element A which has a certain type of atom COMBINES with element B which has its own type of atoms. Dalton said that the relative numbers of any two kinds of atoms in a compound occur in simple ratios. This means when atoms of element A and atoms of element B combine, the ratio of the number of the atoms are whole numbers. For instance, 1 to 2 , 4 to 1 etc You won’t find ratios being 1.4 to 1 or 2 to 3.5 


4. Dalton mentioned that a chemical reaction consists of the rearrangement of the atoms present in the reacting substances to give new chemical combinations present in the substances formed by the reaction. What this means basically means is that when we chemical reaction, atoms are simply being rearranged from their original position to new positions.
You should note that Dalton’s statements are quite correct and although these assumptions are old because he stated them in 19xx, we still find them correct and valid BUT today we know that atoms are not truly indivisible. They are divisible meaning they can be further divided because atoms are made up of particles.

Atomic Symbols and Models
We find it convenient to use symbols to represent the atoms of the different elements. An atomic symbol is a one- or two-letter notation we use in representing an atom that corresponds to a particular element.
Typically, the atomic symbol consists of the first letter, capitalized, from the name of the element, sometimes with an additional letter from the name in lowercase. 
For example, chlorine has the symbol Cl. Other symbols are derived from a name in another language (usually Latin). 
Sodium is given the symbol Na from its Latin name, natrium. Symbols of the elements are listed in the table below
INSERT 
Early in the development of his atomic theory, Dalton built spheres to represent atoms and used combinations of these spheres to represent compounds. Chemists continue to use this idea of representing atoms by three-dimensional models, but because we now know so much more about atoms and molecules than Dalton did, these models have become more refined.
INSERT spheres from then and sphere now 


Deductions from Dalton’s Atomic Theory – What can we deduce from atom’s atomic theory?
Note how atomic theory explains the difference between an element and a compound. (flashcard for AC)
Atomic theory also explains two laws we considered earlier (flashcard for AC: what are the two laws explained by atomic theory?). 
One of these is the law of conservation of mass, which states that the total mass remains constant during a chemical reaction. 

INSERT 

By postulate 2, every atom has a definite mass. 
This is because a chemical reaction only rearranges the chemical combinations of atoms (postulate 4),  
mass must remain constant. 

INSERT 

The second law explained by atomic theory is the law of definite proportions (constant composition). 
Postulate 3 defines a compound as a type of matter containing the atoms of two or more elements in definite proportions.

INSERT 
Because the atoms have definite mass, compounds must have the elements in definite
proportions by mass.

When dealing with theory, it is important to note that a good theory should not only explain known facts and laws but also predict new ones. This should be noted. 
INTRODUCE THE GAME - WHEN THE STUDENT FIGURES OUT THE GAME THEN YOU INTRODUCE IT AS LAW OF MULTIPLE PROPORTION.


The law of multiple proportions, deduced by Dalton from his atomic theory, states that when two elements form more than one compound, the masses of one element in these compounds -for a fixed mass of the other element- are in ratios of small whole numbers.   
[Make this more simple]

GAME LOGIC To illustrate this law:  consider the following. If we take a fixed mass
of carbon, 1.000 gram, and react it with oxygen, we end up with two compounds:
one that contains 1.3321 grams of oxygen for each 1.000 gram of carbon, and one
that contains 2.6642 grams of oxygen per 1.000 gram of carbon. Note that the ratio
of the amounts of oxygen in the two compounds is 2 to 1 (2.6642 _ 1.3321), which
indicates that there must be twice as much oxygen in the second compound. Applying
atomic theory, if we assume that the compound that has 1.3321 grams of oxygen
to 1.000 gram of carbon is CO (the combination of one carbon atom and one oxygen
atom), then the compound that contains twice as much oxygen per 1.000 gram of carbon
must be CO2 (the combination of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms).
The deduction of the law of multiple proportions from atomic theory was important in
convincing chemists of the validity of the theory. Why?

## 2.2 THE STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM
Although Dalton had postulated that atoms were indivisible particles, 
experiments conducted around the beginning of the last century showed 
that atoms themselves consist of particles.

The AI grades the student, unless the student clearly states it (active learning), 
the next section is not unlocked- the student should know this.
These experiments showed that an atom consists of two kinds of particles: a nucleus, the atom’s central core, which is positively charged and contains most of the atom’s mass, and one or more electrons. An electron is a very light, negatively charged particle that exists in the region around the atom’s positively charged nucleus.


## The works of Millikan
In 1909, the U.S. physicist Robert Millikan performed a series of ingenious experiments in which he obtained the charge on the electron by observing how a charged drop of oil falls in the presence and in the absence of an electric field (Figure 2.6). 
 
From this type of experiment, the charge on the electron is found to be 1.602 x 10-19 coulombs (the coulomb, abbreviated C, is a unit of electric charge). 
If you use this charge with the most recent value of the mass-to-charge ratio of the electron, 
you obtain an electron mass of 9.109 c 10-31 kg, which is more
than 1800 times smaller than the mass of the lightest atom (hydrogen). 
This shows quite clearly that the electron is indeed a subatomic particle.


## The works of Rutherford
Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937), a British physicist, put forth the idea of the nuclear model of the atom in 1911, based on experiments done in his laboratory.

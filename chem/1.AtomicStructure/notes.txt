4.Atomic Structure and Bonding
a(i) The concept of atoms, molecules and ions


## The works of Millikan
In 1909, the U.S. physicist Robert Millikan performed a series of ingenious experiments in which he obtained the charge on the electron by observing how a charged drop of oil falls in the presence and in the absence of an electric field (Figure 2.6). 
 
From this type of experiment, the charge on the electron is found to be 1.602 x 10-19 coulombs (the coulomb, abbreviated C, is a unit of electric charge). 
If you use this charge with the most recent value of the mass-to-charge ratio of the electron, 
you obtain an electron mass of 9.109 c 10-31 kg, which is more
than 1800 times smaller than the mass of the lightest atom (hydrogen).

This shows quite clearly that the electron is indeed a subatomic particle.


## The works of Rutherford
Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937), a British physicist, put forth the idea of the nuclear model of the atom in 1911, based on experiments done in his laboratory.

## The works of Moseley
The works of Moseley: periodic table

## The works of J.J Thompson: 
Discovery of the Electron
 
## The works of Bohr


---> Game or activity to cement this in their mind.
1. Keep in mind that the number of protons in the
nucleus (the atomic number) is what uniquely identifies an element.
2. charge of electron: -1.602 x 10sup-19 coulombs
3. charge of proteo: +1.602 x 10sup-19 Coulombs
4. charge of neutron: 0
5. Atomic mass unit or Mass of electron: 9.10939 x 10-31 kg
6. Atomic mass unit or mass of proton: 1.67262 x 10-27 kg
7. Atomic mass unit 0r mass of neutron: 1.67493 x 10-27 kg
8. no of protons = atomic number  of nucleus
9. atomic mass number  of nuclues(A) = no of protons(atomic number) + no of neutrons in a nucleus
10. atoms are naturally occuring so no of protons and electrons are always same but no of neutrons can vary  - leading to isotopes
meaning all nuclei of the atoms of a particular element have the same atomic number (no of protons) but the neclei may have different mass numbers (since
the no of neutrons may vary) remember that the movement of this neutron in unstable atoms leads to decay
but in a stable atom, they can last forever e.g.
11. Isotope sodium-23 
12. oxygen-16
13. oxygen-17
14. oxygen-18
 






(ii) Atomic Structure
Atomic Orbitals: the four quantum numbers, 
The principles that govern the arrangement of atoms into orbitals, 
electron configuration,
atomic number,
mass number and 
isotopes,
specific examples should be drawn from elements of atomic number 1 to 20
Hydrogen
Helium
Lithium
Beryllium
Boron
Carbon
Nitrogen
Oxygen
Fluorine
Neon
Sodium
Magnesium
Aluminum
Silicon
Phosphorus
Sulphur
Chlorine
Argon
Potassium





b. The periodic table and periodicity of elements 
Presentation of the periodic table with a view to recognizing families of elements 
e.g. alkali and alkaline-earth metals, 
halogens, 
the noble gases and 
transition metals


The variation of the following properties: 
ionization energy
ionic radii
electron affinity
electronegativity
electrical conductivities
thermal conductivities


c. Chemical bonding
Electrovalency (ionic) and covalancy (sharing)
The electron configuration of elements and their tendency to attain the noble structure.
Hydrogen bonding and metallic bonding as special types of electrovalency and covalency respectively; 
coordinate bond as a type of covalent bond as illustrated by comples like [Fe(CN)6]3-, [Fe(CN)6]4-, [Cu(NH3)4]2+ and [Ag(NH3)2]+;


d. Shapes of molecules:
Linear: (H2, O2, C12, HCl and CO2),
Non-linear: (H2O)
Tetrahedral: (CH4)
Pyramidal: (NH3)

# Atomic Structure and Bonding

a(i) The concept of atoms, molecules and ions

atoms- show the simplest representation

molecules - instruction : 
molecules are not two Dimensional objects as we draw on paper; 
they are three dimensional and their overall size and shape can have a profound effect on some of their properties, 
especially biological properties.have the simplest exmple with framework, ball and stick and space-filling.


ions




===============================
HOW THESE scientistS Work contributed to the model of atom we believe today.

The works of Dalton:

Visual of Dalton's atom: 
a.indivisible, indestructible solid spheres
b.atoms of same element e.g Sodium atoms are identical in mass and chemical properties but atoms of another element are different e.g chlorine are not.
Make the differene stark.
c.During chemical reaction, new atoms are never created nor destroyed. Instead they 
are re-arranged, seperated or combined.



The works of Millikan:
Visual of Milikan's atom

The works of Rutherford
Visual of Rutherford's atom

The fun biography and works of Moseley

The fun biography and works of J.J Thompson

The fun biography and works of Bohr

Visual of Bohr's atom.






Task 1:
Flashcard - Get 50 out of 70
Task 2: 
In less 200 words, write on the contribution of Dalton,
Milikan, Rutherford, Moseley, Thompson, Bohr. 
Structure the assignment in a way that makes it easy for them 
To see the pros and cons of each scientist.

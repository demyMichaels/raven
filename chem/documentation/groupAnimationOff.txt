I've updated the periodic table app with performance optimizations and added a nice hand-drawn instruction arrow. Here's what changed:

Animation Optimizations:
Scroll-triggered animations - Elements fade in smoothly when they scroll into view using Intersection Observer, rather than all animating on page load
Hover-activated orbits - On desktop, electron orbit animations only run when you hover over an element row
Touch-device support - On mobile/touch devices, animations activate when elements scroll into view (since hover isn't available)
IE bar animation - The ionization energy bars now animate their width when the element becomes visible, rather than immediately
Hand-drawn Instruction Arrow:
Added a charming "Caveat" handwriting font for the instruction text
Created an SVG scribble-style arrow that draws itself in with a nice animation
The arrow gently bounces up and down to catch attention
Added subtle gradient background box with dashed border for the hint
On mobile, the arrow rotates to point downward (matching the vertical scroll direction)
Text automatically adds "(tap to animate!)" on touch devices via CSS
Other Improvements:
Electrons are now completely static by default, saving CPU/GPU resources
The pulsing valence electron effect only activates on hover/visibility
Element rows have a smooth fade-in + slide-up effect when they come into view
Animation classes are properly removed when elements scroll out of view to free up resources

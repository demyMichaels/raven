I've created an enhanced interactive visualizer that beautifully depicts both electrovalency (ionic bonding) and covalency (covalent bonding). Here's what the app includes:

Key Features
🔋 Electrovalent (Ionic) Bonding Section
4 ionic compounds: NaCl, MgO, CaF₂, KCl
Dashed bond visualization representing electrostatic attraction between ions
Glowing ion effect with colored rings showing charges
Electron transfer diagrams showing how electrons move from metal to non-metal
Displays charge states (Na⁺, Cl⁻, etc.)
🔗 Covalent Bonding Section
6 covalent molecules: H₂, O₂, Cl₂, H₂O, NH₃, CH₄
Solid bond visualization in green representing shared electrons
Double bond support for O₂
Electron sharing diagrams showing bonding and lone pairs
📊 Educational Features
Tabbed interface to switch between ionic and covalent examples
Key point badges explaining each bond type
Detailed info panel with:
Bond type, structure, electrons involved
Conductivity properties
Visual electron transfer/sharing diagrams
Comparison table highlighting differences between ionic and covalent bonds
🎨 Visual Design
Orange color scheme for ionic compounds
Green color scheme for covalent compounds
3D interactive models with rotation and zoom
Dark/light mode support
Fully responsive for mobile

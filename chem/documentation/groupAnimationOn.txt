I've implemented the tab-based group selector! Here's what I added:

Features Added:
🗂️ Tab Navigation
4 clickable tabs at the top: Group 1, Group 2, Group 17, and Group 18
Each tab shows the group number and valence electron count
Tabs have unique accent colors that match the group's theme
🎨 Color-Coded Groups
Group 1 (Alkali Metals) - Green (#00ffaa)
Group 2 (Alkaline Earth Metals) - Orange (#ff9f43)
Group 17 (Halogens) - Purple (#a55eea)
Group 18 (Noble Gases) - Blue (#45aaf2)
📚 Dynamic Content
When you switch tabs, everything updates:

Title and subtitle
Key insight box with group-specific explanations
Element cards with correct data
Bohr models showing correct electron configurations
Ionization energy bars (scaled to global max for fair comparison)
Legend showing valence electron count
"Why" section with group-specific explanations
📊 Educational Comparisons
Group 2 explains why IE is higher than Group 1
Group 17 explains why halogens have high IE
Group 18 explains why noble gases have the highest IE
All groups show the decreasing trend down the group
✨ Smooth Transitions
Elements fade in with staggered animation when switching groups
Accent colors transition smoothly
Remove electron button still works with appropriate speed based on IE
The ionization energy bars are now scaled to the global maximum (Helium at 2372 kJ/mol), so you can visually compare IE across different groups!

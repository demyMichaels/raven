Acids, Bases and Salts
a. General characteristics, properties and uses of acids, bases and salts. 
"Acids/base indicators, basicity of acids; normal, acidic, basic and double salts. An acid defined as a substance whose aqueous solution furnishes H3O+ions or as a proton donor.                                                                              Ethanoic, citric and tartaric acids as examples of naturally occurring organic acids,  alums as examples
of double salts, preparation of salts by neutralization,  precipitation and action of acids on metals.                                                                                            Oxides and trioxocarbonate (IV) salts"

"b. Qualitative comparison of the conductance of molar solutions of
strong and weak acids and bases, relationship between conductance and amount of ions present."

c. pH and pOH scale: simple calculations, significance of pH value in everyday life, Buffer solution

d. Acid/base titrations

e. Hydrolysis of salts:  simple examples such as NH4Cl, AlCl3, Na2CO3 and CH3COONa

For automatic payouts, you'll need a backend server to:

Call Paystack Transfer API to send money to referrers
Verify bank accounts using Paystack's Resolve Account endpoint
Handle webhooks for payment confirmations




The app tracks referrals, 
credits earnings automatically when a referred user subscribes, 
and provides a clear withdrawal flow. 
Would you like me to add any additional features or modify the reward structure?

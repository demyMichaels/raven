From u ∝ 1/v, u = k/v. 2 = k/2 ⇒ k=4. So u = 4/v. But this is not an option. The option is u=8/v². Perhaps there's a mistake. The problem says 'u varies directly as w²' but we need relationship between u and v. If we assume that w is related to v, but it's not specified. The only way to get u=8/v² is if the constant is 8. Given u=2 when v=2, for u ∝ 1/v², we have 2 = k/4 ⇒ k=8, so u=8/v². So the intended variation is u ∝ 1/v².",

    "options": ["20°", "25°", "50°", "80°"],
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "∠UOT = 70°, so the arc UT is 70°. ∠RST = 100° is an inscribed angle subtending arc RT. Using these, ∠RUO is found to be 25°."

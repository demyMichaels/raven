    "question": "An expansion of quantity demanded occurs when price:",
    "options": [
      "falls, causing a downward movement along the curve.",
      "rises, causing an upward movement along the curve.",
      "falls, causing the curve to shift right.",
      "rises, causing the curve to shift left."
    ],
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "An **expansion** is a movement down the fixed demand curve, caused by a fall in price."

      "up and to the left along the curve.",
      "to the left of the demand curve."

      "necessity (income inelastic).",
      "inferior good.",
      "complementary good."
    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "A positive YED means it is a normal good. Since it is between 0 and 1 (YED < 1), it is a **necessity** (income inelastic)."

      "at the intersection with the price axis.",
      "at the midpoint of the curve.",
      "at the intersection with the quantity axis.",

      "the cost of production.",
      "the wages of workers."

      "large proportion of a consumer's income.",
      "small proportion of a consumer's income.",
      "high level of advertising.",
      "low level of government subsidy."
    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "If a good is cheap (takes a **small proportion of income**), consumers barely notice price changes, making demand inelastic."

      "joint demand.",
      "a shift in the supply curve of jumpers.",
      "competitive demand.",
      "income elasticity of demand."

    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "A fall in the price of raw material (wool) lowers the cost of production, shifting the **supply curve** for jumpers to the right, leading to a lower equilibrium price and a higher quantity demanded."

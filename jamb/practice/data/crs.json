    "question": "In the biblical context, a **'covenant'** is best defined as a:",
    "options": [
      "Legally binding contract between equal parties.",
      "A solemn, binding agreement between two parties, often initiated by God.",
      "A temporary promise that can be broken without consequence.",
      "A set of suggestions for righteous living."
    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "A covenant is not a mere contract but a divinely established bond. It's solemn, binding, and unilateral in initiation (God sets the terms) while demanding a bilateral response (human obedience or faith)."
  },
  {
    "id": "COV_002",
    "topic_focus": "Nature of Covenant",
    "question": "A key feature of a biblical covenant that distinguishes it from a simple contract is its emphasis on:",
    "options": [
      "Financial exchange and profit.",
      "Relationship and commitment, often sealed with a sign.",
      "Negotiation between parties of equal power.",
      "Independence and personal freedom."
    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Biblical covenants create or restore a **relationship** (e.g., 'I will be your God, and you will be my people') and use visible signs (like the rainbow or circumcision) as perpetual reminders of the commitment, which transcend mere legal terms."

      "God's displeasure with Abraham.",

    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "This ritual (cutting a covenant) was a solemn act where the one passing through implied: 'May I be cut in two like these animals if I break this agreement.' Since God alone passed through, it highlighted the **unilateral, unconditional** nature of the covenant on His part."

    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Genesis 6:5 states that 'the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.' The earth was also filled with violence (Gen. 6:11)."

    ],
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "The promise of 'stars' was given later in Genesis 15, to reassure Abraham when he was without a biological heir. The initial call in Gen. 12:1-3 contained the three main components: Land, Seed (nation), and Blessing (universal)."
  },

      "The Passover lamb."
    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Genesis 17:10-14 mandates **circumcision** as the 'sign of the covenant between me and you.' It was a perpetual, physical mark placed upon the male members of Abraham's household and future descendants."

    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Genesis 17:19 explicitly states: 'Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name **Isaac**. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his offspring after him.' Ishmael was blessed but not the covenant heir."

    ],
    "answer": "b",

      "With the circumcision of the Israelites.",
      "With the parting of the Red Sea."
    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Exodus 24:8 describes Moses sprinkling the **blood of the sacrifices** on the people, saying, 'Behold the blood of the covenant that the LORD has made with you in accordance with all these words.' Blood was essential for sealing this covenant."

    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Deuteronomy 28 is the **'covenant sanctions'** chapter, explicitly detailing how God would bless and how He would curse. It’s the clearest example of a conditional covenant."

      "The people demanded a new agreement."
    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Jeremiah 31:32 directly contrasts the New Covenant with the Old (Mosaic), stating, 'not like the covenant that I made with their fathers... my covenant that **they broke**.' The New Covenant was needed because of Israel's inability to keep the Old Covenant's demands."

    ],
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Jeremiah 31:33 promises: 'I will put my law within them, and I will write it **on their hearts**.' This internal inscription contrasts with the external nature of the Law written on the stone tablets of the Mosaic Covenant."

    ],
    "answer": "c",

    "options": [
      "Limited to scholars and priests.",

    ],
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The prophecy states, '...they shall **all know me**, from the least of them to the greatest.' This points to a new, internal, and personal knowledge of God for every member of the New Covenant."

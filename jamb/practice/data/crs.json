      "God is present everywhere.",
      "God is perfectly holy."
    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "God's sovereignty refers to His right and power to rule over all creation without any external limitation. It is His supreme authority, making Him the ultimate King and Controller."
  },
  {
    "id": "SOV_002",
    "topic_focus": "God's Will and Sovereignty",
    "question": "According to the doctrine of sovereignty, God's will is:",
    "options": [
      "Subject to human free will.",
      "Ultimately fulfilled in all creation.",

    "answer": "b",

    "topic_focus": "Jeremiah's Potter Analogy",
    "question": "The prophet Jeremiah's potter and clay analogy (Jer. 18:1-16) illustrates God's sovereignty by showing:",
    "options": [
      "That humans can resist God's plan indefinitely.",
      "God's absolute right to shape nations as He sees fit.",
      "That God's plans are easily broken.",
      "The importance of skilled craftsmanship."
    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The central point of the analogy is the **Potter's absolute control and right** over the clay. God has the unquestionable authority to mold, destroy, and reshape nations and individuals based on His wisdom and their response (repentance or rebellion)."

      "The plants and trees."
    ],
    "answer": "c",

  },
  {
    "id": "SOV_008",
    "topic_focus": "Distinction of Man's Creation",

    "explanation": "The first three days establish the **form/habitats** (Light/Dark, Waters/Sky, Land/Sea), and the next three days fill them with **fullness/inhabitants** (Sun/Moon, Birds/Fish, Animals/Man). This systematic approach emphasizes divine order."

    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The *Imago Dei* is a functional concept. Just as a king would erect a statue of himself to signify his rule in a distant province, humans are God's living representatives, tasked with extending His righteous dominion over the world."

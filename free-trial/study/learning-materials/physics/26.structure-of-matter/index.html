Structure of Matter and Kinetic Theory 
(a) Molecular nature of matter 

(i) atoms and molecules;

(ii) molecular theory: 
explanation of Brownian motion, 
diffusion, surface tension, 
capillarity, 
adhesion, 
cohesion and 
angles of contact law of definite proportion; 

(iii) examples and applications.


Candidates should be able to: 
i.  differentiate between atoms and molecules;
ii.  use molecular theory to explain 
Brownian motion, 
diffusion, 
surface, tension, 
capillarity, 
adhesion, 
cohesion and 
angle of contact; 



(b) Kinetic Theory 
(i) assumptions of the kinetic theory 
(ii) using the theory to explain the pressure exerted by gas, Boyle’s law, Charles’ law, 
melting, 
boiling, 
vapourization, 
change in temperature, 
evaporation, etc

Thermal Expansion 

(a) Solids 
(i) definition and determination of linear, volume and area expansivities;
(ii) effects and applications, e.g. expansion in building strips and railway lines; 
(iii) relationship between different expansivities.

(b) Liquids 
(i) volume expansivity; 
(ii) real and apparent expansivities;
(iii) determination of volume expansivity; 
(iv) anomalous expansion of water. 

Candidates should be able to:  
i. determine linear and volume expansivities; 
ii. assess the effects and applications of thermal expansivities; 
iii.  determine the relationship between different expansivities;  
iv. determine volume, apparent, and real expansivities of liquids; 
v. analyse the anomalous expansion of water.

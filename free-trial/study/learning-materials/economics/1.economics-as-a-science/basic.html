1. ECONOMICS – MEANING AND BASIC CONCEPTS

Definition: Economics like other social science subjects has no specific definition. As there are many Economists, so there are many definitions of the subject – Economics. These definitions depend greatly on the perception of the definer of the subject. These inevitable variations in the definition of Economics arise because of the fact that the subject studies human beings and their behaviours which can never be the same. These divergent human behaviours are subject to different interpretations. To substantiate our argument that Economics has multi-farious definitions, we will quote some definitions given by those we consider as authorities in Economics.

Adam Smith (1776): "an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations". John Stuart Mill (1843): "the practical science of the production and distribution of wealth." Alfred Marshal (1890): "A study of mankind in the ordinary business of life".

However, of all the definitions of Economics adduced by Economists, the one that is most widely acceptable by the generality of Economists is the one put forward by Professor (Lord) Lionel C. Robbins in 1932. According to Professor Robbins, Economics may be defined as "a Science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses". The above definition is more embracing because it embodies the basic concepts of Economics and the main fundamental problems of man – wants, scarcity, choice, exchange and opportunity cost. To properly explain the above definition adduced by Robbins, we decided to underline the key words.

According to Robbins' definition, Economics is a science, and below is an explanation why Economics is called a science. Economics is a science which studies human behaviours and that makes it a social science and not a natural or pure science. As a social science, Economics deals mainly with the activities of man. By ends, it means human wants, desires or needs. These human wants are numerous relative to resources used in satisfying them. By scarce means, he means the limited available resources used in satisfying numerous human wants. That is, the resources used in satisfying human wants which he called "means" are scarce or not many, relative to their demand. By alternative uses, it means that these scarce resources can be used for different purposes. For instance, a piece of land can be used to build a house or for farming. That is, the most pressing needs have to be satisfied first leaving others that are not most pressing till the time more resources will be made available. Since human wants are unlimited and insatiable relative to the available resources, human beings have to choose the most pressing needs and leave others that are less important relative to scarce resources. This is why Economics is also known as a science that studies scarce resources. As a result of the unlimited and insatiable nature of human needs, coupled with the scarce resources used in the satisfaction of these wants human beings are faced with the problems of wants, scarcity, scale of preference, choice and opportunity cost.

1.1 SCOPE/BASIC CONCEPTS OF ECONOMICS
Economics covers the following basic aspects of human lives:


WANTS
Wants simply means the desire or wish to own goods or services that give satisfaction. Human beings want or need many things at a particular time. The basic needs or wants of man are food, shelter and clothing. As these basic needs are satisfied, other needs will arise. This is why we say that human wants are insatiable. This is because, human wants are unlimited while resources used in satisfying them are limited.




1.2 SCARCITY
Scarcity refers to the limited available resources used in satisfying the unlimited human wants. These resources are scarce relative to their demand. It is as a result of scarcity of resources that made the study of Economics very essential in order to find alternative uses of these scarce resources. The available resources cannot satisfy all human wants. Since human wants are unlimited or insatiable relative to the available resources, we have to choose the most pressing ones and leave others that are less important because resources are scarce.

For instance, ten students need ten pairs of school sandals but they are able to buy seven pairs of school sandals due to the insufficiency of resources (money), it therefore implies scarcity of school sandals relative to the needs of the students.


Economically, resources such as money, material, time, productive resources etc. are relatively scarce to the people's demand.

The producers, consumers as well as government face the problem of scarcity and this leads us to the study of what to produce, how to produce, for whom to produce and how to distribute.




1.3 SCALE OF PREFERENCE
Scale of preference refers to a list of individual wants in order of their relative importance. The drawing of scale of preference will make it easier for choice to be made. Since human wants are unlimited and the available resources used in satisfying these wants are limited and cannot satisfy all human wants; human beings have no choice than to rank these needs in order of their relative importance, called scale of preference, placing more important or pressing needs first before the less important ones that may be satisfied at a latter day. This hierarchicalization of needs which is inevitable as a result of limited resources helps one to make rational choices. For example, a student who is in dire need of textbooks, sandals, biro, shoes, trousers, shirts, exercise book, etc., but with limited resources, may draw his scale of preference like this:
\[\text{Table 1.1: A student's Scale of Preference}\]

| Items Needed | Price (N) |
|---|---|
| Exercise Book    | 2.00    |
| Biro    | 50    |
| Textbook    | 5.00    |
| Sandals    | 10.00    |
| Shirts    | 15.00    |
| Trousers    | 12.00    |
| Shoes    | 30.00    |

Suppose the student has N20.00 at hand at the time he needed the above items; judging from his scale of preference above, he can afford to purchase only exercise book, biro, textbook and sandals as a result of his limited available resources of N20.00 relative to his needs. This student will therefore face the problem of choice and opportunity cost.

When a student follows or makes use of the above table i.e. according to how important they are, the student is said to behave rationally.





1.4 WHY SCALE OF PREFERENCE IS NECESSARY

1. Scale of preference helps us to rank our needs in order of their relative importance.
2. It helps or aids an individual to make rational choices.
3. It leads to efficient utilization of limited available resources.
4. The drawing of scale of preference shows our needs at a glance and reminds us of such needs and compels us to plan for the satisfaction of such needs.
5. Since human wants are numerous and the resources to satisfy them are scarce, scale of preference is therefore necessary to aid us to make choices that give maximum satisfaction.
6. The scale of preference aids an individual to forgo those wants he cannot satisfy as a result of his limited available resources.



1.5 CHOICE
Choice involves decision making. Choice arises as a result of numerous human wants and the scarcity of the resources used in satisfying these wants. Choice therefore, arises as a result of scarcity. Choice in this case means the act of selecting some needs for satisfaction out of many others based on the resources available to the person making the decision. Man is faced with the problem of choice because, as soon as some needs are satisfied, other needs will arise. Since it is impossible for any human being to satisfy all his wants at a particular time, human beings must choose the most pressing wants for satisfaction based on the resources within his reach. For instance, every human being will like to eat good food, own a nice house with all the necessary household appliances like television and video sets, radio set, refrigerator, air conditioner, etc. But not everybody can afford all these luxuries at a time. As a result, the person will have to choose the most pressing needs among the above itemised needs. In this case the choosing of one want in place of another will be done based on the above drawn scale of preference.

Government also makes a choice on how to allocate the available resources concerning what goods and services to produce for her citizens and the proportion of the resources to each sector such as agricultural sector, health sector, administration, educational sector e.t.c.

For firms, a choice of the kind of business to embark upon, wages to pay, forms of distribution to embark upon must be made because of the limited resources.

Conclusively, the individuals, government and firms have to choose between alternatives in order to achieve their objectives i.e. maximization of utility, provision of services or welfare and maximization of profit respectively.



1.6 OPPORTUNITY COST
Opportunity cost means the alternative foregone or sacrifice made in order to satisfy

another want. It refers to the need that is left unsatisfied in order to satisfy another more pressing need. For instance, in the student's scale of preference above; the cost of the exercise book, biro, textbook and sandals bought are the shirt, trousers and shoes he had left unbought.

The shirt, trouser and shoes that were left unsatisfied or unbought are known as alternative, forgone or sacrificed alternatives. This alternative forgone or sacrificed is known in Economics as opportunity cost or real or true cost.





1.7. IMPORTANCE OF OPPORTUNITY COST TO AN INDIVIDUAL, A FIRM AND A GOVERNMENT

Opportunity cost like other basic concepts of Economics - scarcity, scale of preference and choice is important to an individual who represents the consumer or household, or firm or productive unit and the government that form the three decision making bodies in an economy. The concept of opportunity cost arises from choice which is central to the subject-matter of economics and this arises as a result of the limited available resources vis-a-vis unlimited human wants. Since every economic problem involves choice and every choice involves opportunity cost, therefore, opportunity cost is very important.

Also, opportunity cost is important because it involves allocation of scarce resources to pressing areas of needs. It also shows that every activity involves a sacrifice whether on the side of an individual, a firm or government. To an individual who aims at maximising his utility from his limited available resources, he will have to allocate these limited resources to those wants that are more important. Opportunity cost helps the individual to make judicious use of his scarce resources. For instance, an individual farmer who has a piece of land and two different types of crops like yam and cassava will plant either of them since he may not plant the two on the same land at the same time. If he grows cassava because of the present economic position of garri, the opportunity cost of cassava is the yam he has sacrificed or forgone to plant.

Opportunity cost is also important to a firm because the firm has to choose to allocate its limited available raw materials in the production of a particular product with high demand at the expense of other products with low demand in order to enable it to maximise profit.

To a government, opportunity cost helps it in the preparation of its budget. The government will therefore, decide the sector it will allocate more resources. Government may therefore, allocate more resources to education at the expense of other sectors. Opportunity cost also aids a government in policy making. Finally, all said and done, there is an element of opportunity cost in the activities of an individual, a firm and a government.



1.8 RELEVANCE OF THE CONCEPT OF OPPORTUNITY COST TO THE ECONOMIES OF WEST AFRICAN COUNTRIES

The concept of opportunity cost is relevant to the Economics of West African Countries. The concept emphasizes the basic problem of choice which is the core of the subject matter of Economics as a result of the limited available resources vis-a-vis unlimited human wants. Since every economic problem involves choice and every choice involves opportunity cost, therefore, opportunity cost is relevant to the economies of West African countries. Also, the concept is relevant because it involves allocation of scarce resources to pressing areas of need. It also shows that every activity involves a sacrifice whether on the side of an individual, a firm or a government.





1.9 WHY WE STUDY ECONOMICS AND THE PROBLEMS THE STUDY OF ECONOMICS WILL HELP US TO SOLVE

We study Economics which is a branch of the social sciences because of the following reasons.
1. Human Wants: We study Economics because, it deals with human beings and the satisfaction of their numerous wants with their limited available resources.
2. Allocation Of Scarce Resources: As a result of the fact that the resources within the limit of human beings are not in abundance, it becomes necessary for us to study Economics and decide the alternative uses of these scarce resources in order to satisfy our numerous wants.
3. Production: We also study Economics because, it deals with the fundamental questions of what, where, for whom and how to produce goods and services in order to satisfy human wants.
4. Distribution: After production, Economics goes further to study how the goods and services produced are to be distributed.
5. Hoarding: The study of Economics enables us to monitor the nefarious activities of hoarders that disturb the smooth distribution of goods and services and how to counteract them.
6. Consumption: The study of Economics enables us to know the pattern of consumption of goods and services in our society.
7. Budget: The study of Economics is also important because, the Economists, after studying human beings and the economic activities of the country will be in a better position to estimate a country's total revenue, human wants and project the total expenditure in a given year.

8. To Take Part in Government: The study of Economics prepares us to take active part in the act of governance of our country.
9. Logical Thinking: The study of Economics helps to develop in us an inquisitive, well balanced and highly philosophical and logical thinking mind.
10. Economic Analysis: The study of Economics enables us to build up theories and tools of economic analysis.
11. Human Behaviour: The study of Economics enables us to understand individual differences and why people behave the way they do in their material pursuit.
12. The study of Economic theories and laws like elasticity of demand and supply and the laws of demand and supply enables agents to maximise profits subject to cost minimization.
13. The study of economics assists individuals to be independent and be practical individuals. This is possible through the application of practical approaches to emerging issues and providing solutions to daily problems.
E.g. An educational system will stop admission of students or expansion when Average Variable Cost (AVC) equals Marginal Cost (MC) i.e. AVC = MC because that is the optimum point at which the cost will be minimum and the output will be maximum.




















1.10 WHY ECONOMICS IS A SCIENCE
Economics is called a science subject because it uses scientific measures to explain observed phenomena and predict the outcome of future events. This scientific method of observation is generally referred to as inductive method. Economics, like all other science subjects is also called a science as a result of the following reasons:
What Is Science? According to Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English by A.S. Hornby, "Science is knowledge arranged in an orderly manner, especially knowledge obtained by observation and testing of facts and the pursuit of such knowledge". Like all other science subjects, Economics is a body of knowledge arranged in an orderly manner and this knowledge is obtained by observing human beings, their behaviours and their social environment. The facts obtained from this observation are tested in order to arrive at certain laws like: Laws of demand and supply, law of diminishing returns, law of marginal utility, etc. These laws have been empirically tested within the society and experimented on the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.
Economics therefore, possesses those attributes of science, like investigation and observation, arrangement, classification and interpretation of facts, empirical testing of facts, the deductive and inductive methods of theories used to formulate laws and finally, establishing principles, propositions, generalizations, theories and laws used for the analysis, prediction and forecasting of economic problems and solutions. It is as a result of the above reasons that students of Economics are many universities graduate with Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree and not Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree. The above evidences serve as empirical proof that Economics like other subjects that possess similar qualities is a science subject. However, Economics is not a natural or pure or physical science, but a social science.

1.11 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ECONOMICS AND OTHER SCIENCE SUBJECTS
Economics is different from other science subjects like physics and chemistry. One of their areas of differences is that while Economics belongs to the group called social sciences, Physics and Chemistry belong to the area of physical or natural or pure sciences.
Another area of difference is that Economics as a social science studies mainly human beings and their behaviours while pure sciences like Physics and Chemistry study mainly inanimate objects.
Unlike the natural or physical sciences that can isolate their objects of study in order to arrive at a conclusion, Economics which is a social science, the objects of study can never be isolated. When an Economist is studying human beings and their behaviours, he is at the same time studying himself and his behaviours.
Economics is also different from natural or physical sciences like Physics and Chemistry because, it does not have a defined laboratory and uses no specific apparatuses. Human society as a whole serves as laboratory for Economics.
Another area of difference between Economics and other science subjects like Physics and Chemistry is that experiments performed in Economics are not subjected to effective control as is done in Physics and Chemistry.
Furthermore, the objects of study of physics or natural sciences are rigid and not flexible in their reactions like human behaviours that constitute the objects of study of Economics which are flexible and vary with situations.  
Economics, unlike the pure science subjects, does not arrive at definite conclusions because human beings and their behaviours change like weather and not consistent. As a result of this inconsistency in human beings who have free will and so cannot be subjected to rigid unbending laws. Economists coined the Latin phrase \textit{ceteris paribus} (other things being equal) to counteract the uncertainty of their laws.

Finally, while the natural sciences use positive statements which state "what is" and can be refuted by contradictory evidence, Economics uses normative statement which states "what ought to be" and cannot be refuted by contradictory evidence.

1.12 THE BRANCHES OF ECONOMICS  
Economics is divided into two main broad areas of Micro-economics and Macro-economics. Micro-economics is the study of the small units of the economy. \textit{Mikros} is a Greek word which means small. Micro-economics therefore involves the analysis of the decisions of the basic decision-making units of households, firms and governments. For instance, how an individual or a household earns income and how the income is spent are examples of micro-economics.

Macro-economics on the other hand deals with the aggregate economic problems of the society at large. \textit{Makros} is the Greek word for large. Macro-economics therefore studies such topics as inflation which is concerned with the general level of prices and as it affects everybody in the society, national income, aggregate level of unemployment, etc.

Economics can also be classified into pure and applied categories. Pure Economics involves a body of laws, theories or principles derived from the study of economic behaviour. Applied Economics is concerned with the use of laws, theories or principles in the analysis and solving of contemporary economic problems. There are other branches of Economics like: Monetary Economics which deals with money and banking; Public Finance which is about taxation, public revenue and expenditure; Business Economics which deals with trade, business organisation and accounting; Development Economics that handles economic planning or development plan and national economies; Mathematical Economics or Econometrics which deals with data collection, analysis and statistics; Demography that deals with population issues; Industrial Economics which talks about personnel management, labour and industrial relations, etc.

1.13 MANKIND'S ACTIVITIES THAT ARE STUDIED IN ECONOMICS  
Mankind's activities studied in Economics include: production, distribution or exchange and consumption of goods and services. Production which is studied in Economics takes the form of transformation of raw materials into finished goods and the distribution and provision of goods and services in order to satisfy human wants. It can equally be said that production is the creation of utility, while utility is the ability of any commodity or service to satisfy human want. As defined above, production also involves rendering of services which satisfy human wants.

In Economics, production is said to be complete when the goods and services produced reach the final users or consumers. Economics therefore, studies the chain or channel of distribution of goods and services which starts from the producer - wholesaler - retailer - consumer. The wholesalers and retailers who are in-between the producers and consumers are known in Economics as middlemen.

Since the essence of production is to satisfy human wants, goods and services produced must be consumed in order to satisfy such human wants. Consumption therefore, is the use of goods and services for the direct satisfaction of human wants. Since goods and services produced are of two types - consumer and capital goods and services; consumer goods are used to satisfy consumers' immediate wants while the capital or producer's ones are used for further production of goods and services.

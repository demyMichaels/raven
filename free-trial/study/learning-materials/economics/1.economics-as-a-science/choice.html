CHOICE
Choice involves decision making. Choice arises as a result of numerous human wants and the scarcity of the resources used in satisfying these wants. Choice therefore, arises as a result of scarcity. Choice in this case means the act of selecting some needs for satisfaction out of many others based on the resources available to the person making the decision. Man is faced with the problem of choice because, as soon as some needs are satisfied, other needs will arise. Since it is impossible for any human being to satisfy all his wants at a particular time, human beings must choose the most pressing wants for satisfaction based on the resources within his reach. For instance, every human being will like to eat good food, own a nice house with all the necessary household appliances like television and video sets, radio set, refrigerator, air conditioner, etc. But not everybody can afford all these luxuries at a time. As a result, the person will have to choose the most pressing needs among the above itemised needs. In this case the choosing of one want in place of another will be done based on the above drawn scale of preference.

Government also makes a choice on how to allocate the available resources concerning what goods and services to produce for her citizens and the proportion of the resources to each sector such as agricultural sector, health sector, administration, educational sector e.t.c.

For firms, a choice of the kind of business to embark upon, wages to pay, forms of distribution to embark upon must be made because of the limited resources.

Conclusively, the individuals, government and firms have to choose between alternatives in order to achieve their objectives i.e. maximization of utility, provision of services or welfare and maximization of profit respectively.

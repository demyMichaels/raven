2.2 POWER

Definition: Power is the capacity to affect another’s behaviour by the threat of sanction. 
The sanctions may be negative or positive. Thus, a political leader may have the ability to control the actions of others by promising those who support him wealth or honours, or he may threaten to deny such rewards to those who oppose him. However, sanctions are used if there is non-compliance.

Forms of Power
1. Political power: 
The elected President or Prime Minister of a state possesses political power. It is the power derived from the people and the constitution.

2. Economic power: 
An individual in possession of economic resources could use such to influence issues in a state. He can also command respect and has the ability of controlling people’s emotions, actions, etc
.
3. Military power:
 The armed forces – army, navy and airforce – control the instruments of violence in a country. These instruments can easily be manipulated to overthrow a civilian government and for the defence of the state against external aggression
.
4. Physical power: 
It is the application of force in compelling obedience. The outcome of this application could bring discomfort or even a disastrous end.




The acquisition and exercise of power

1. The constitution: 
The constitution specifies how powers should be acquired and how it should be exercised. Through elections, power held by the people is transferred to a body called government.

2. Through coercion: 
Power may be acquired through the use of force, e.g. the military. Most developing countries in Africa, Latin America, etc. have experienced change of government through coup’d’etat.

3. Through charisma: 
Power can be acquired through intelligence or a person’s charisma.

4. Through economic resources: 
This may include money and property. An individual can acquire political power and command the respect of other people through economic strength.

5. Through position of authority: 
Authority and power are complementary. So, position of authority confers power on the person exercising it.

6. Through inheritance: 
This is based on heredity and it is mostly with the royal families. Powers are acquired, when the kingship or queenship is vacant.

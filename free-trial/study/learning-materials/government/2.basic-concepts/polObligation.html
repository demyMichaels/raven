Political Obligation
Authority gives rulers the right to command 
while political obligation deals with why people obey government.

We shall look at the several theories of obligation and see reasons why people obey government.

1. The theory of coercion**: The assumption is there that men obey government because they recognise their incapacity in relation to government. 
This incapacity is in relation to power or coercive force, 
other words, men obey force because they are compelled to do so.

2. **Prudential obligation**: Men obey government because they value their individual freedom and conveniences more than the sufferings and pains which are attendant in disobedience. According to Thomas Hobbes, men are aware of the consequences of disobedience and for the most part, men would try to avoid the force of the law and the punishments which are inherent in law. Again, let us look at the premise upon which Hobbesian absolutism was based. To have an orderly and stable society in which everyone keeps the law as well as perform their duties, there must be an absolute power capable of imposing its will on all the citizens. The citizens must recognise the superiority of this power as well as the readiness of the power to invoke superiority and to punish offenders.

3. **The liberal theory of obligation**: This assumes that men obey government because they are in the habit of obedience. Political obligation therefore is seen as a by-product of the socialisation process in any society. This is to say that men are born into societies where there are existing rules and structures of authority and are socialised by various methods into the habits and usages of their societies. Socialisation process imposes on the citizens the tendency or the habit of obedience.

4. **The social contract theory**: According to this theory, the political obligation derives from the relationship between the ruler and the ruled. 
This relationship is created by a contract which defines explicitly the rights and obligations of each party.  
Locke maintained that the society is a product of a social contract, i.e. of an agreement between individuals to come together to avoid chaos which is part of the characteristics of the state of nature. Social contract confers on a person or a group of persons the authority to manage the affairs of society on behalf of all. The contract also defines the rights and the obligations of all.

5. The theory of the common good:
It assumes that rulers or states pursue certain moral ends which are in the interest of all. The state is treated as a necessary means of fulfilling some of our general moral obligation, for the state with its system of enforceable laws helps to harness our acknowledged moral obligation for purposes of promoting social justice and the common good.

 6. The theory of the general will:
This is the theory favoured by philosophers of totalitarianism and paternalism such as Plato and Hegel.  
This theory is expressing that societies have a general will of purpose which they pursue and that this general purpose is in the interest of all. It is for this reason that the individual is enjoined to act in such ways as to enhance the opportunity for attaining the general will, since governments or rulers are often the instrument for attaining the general will

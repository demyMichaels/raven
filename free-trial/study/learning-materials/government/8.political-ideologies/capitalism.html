 CAPITALISM
Definition: Capitalism can be defined as an economic system in which the means of production, exchange and distribution of goods and services are in the hands of private persons, providing or borrowing the necessary capital and taking the profits after all the costs of the
production have been met. However, it should be noted that government’s participation in production is very low in a capitalist economy. Private individuals have an edge over the government in this area. USA is a good example of a capitalist economy.

Features of Capitalism
1. Consumer sovereignty: Choices are made by the people; they decide how to spend their money.
2. Production: What to be produced is based on consumers’ choice.
3. Ownership of means of production: Means of production of goods and services, distribution and exchange are in the hands of private individuals.
4. Competitive market: It operates a competitive market, where individuals try to out-rival others.
5. Government participation: Government participation is very low in a capitalist economy.
6. Profit: The basic motive in production is profit-making.
7. Specialisation: It is a highly specialised system coupled with a high degree of efficiency.
8. Sourcing for capital: Individuals can borrow or provide the necessary capital for themselves for production.
9. Demand and Supply: The economy is subject to the market forces of demand and supply.
10. Labour: Labour is a marketable commodity in a capitalist economy.
11. Many producers: There are many producers as well as buyers.
12. Class war: The order of the day in a capitalist economy is the existence of class war between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.
13. Rule of law: There is also the existence of the principle of liberty and the rule of law.


Advantages of Capitalism
1. Competition: The system is open and it encourages competition. Effort is geared towards having the best for the consumers.
2. Specialisation: There is specialisation and hard work in the system.
3. Choice: The people have a choice to make in almost everything needed or demanded.
4. Economic development: Economic developments rapid because the system is all-embracing.
5. Initiatives: Initiatives are encouraged; they are supported and not killed.
6. Economic/political growth: The people can contribute to the political and economic growth of the system.
7. Democratic in nature: Capitalism is democratic. Individuals are free to pursue any goal or to go into production without any hindrance.
8. Quality of goods: Capitalism brings about increase in the quality of goods and services produced and provided respectively.
9. Private ownership: This is because the system encourages hard work and so private ownership of property is made possible.
10. Consumer sovereignty: Since capitalism is a competitive system, the people have choices in the purchase of goods and services available.



Disadvantages of Capitalism
1. Exploitation: The system is outright exploitative. For example, some companies exploit their employees by paying them peanuts even when they are making enough profits.

2. **Profiteering:** Producers make excessive profits to the detriment of the consumers.

3. **Inequality:** There is political and economic inequality in the system. The gap between the rich and the poor is very wide.

4. **Unemployment:** There is large-scale unemployment in the system. The few available jobs created cannot go round the large number of job seekers.

5. **Rivalry:** There is an unhealthy rivalry among producers of different or same products in a capitalist system.

6. **Crime:** Unemployment can make people go into crime, e.g. smuggling, 419 (Advance Fee Fraud), etc.

7. **Wage-slave:** Capitalism makes a worker a ‘wage slave’. His ability to express himself in his work is absent.

8. **Income distribution:** Income is not justifiably distributed in a capitalist system.

9. **Price system:** The price system does not respond to the real needs of the community but to the demands of those who have money to spend.

10. **Insecurity:** Capitalism introduces and produces insecurity. For example, the lives of some rich people are not secure.

11. **Strike:** It is a system where the employers and the employed are constantly at each other’s throat. Sometimes, it degenerates into workers going on strike as a result of this.



**Capitalist Mode of Production**

Two modes of production dominate the present world. They are the capitalist mode and the socialist mode of production. However, our attention here is to discuss the capitalist mode of production.

Africa’s integration into the mainstream of the world capitalist system through western colonialism and imperialism was eventful and had greatly influenced and re-shaped the economic and political development of contemporary Africa.

In a capitalist mode of production, three major features are visible.

1. **Uneven distribution:** The means of production are very unevenly distributed, bringing a society divided into a small group of people that monopolised the means of production.

2. **The greater part of the population:** They are without means of production, but their labour power.

3. **Commodity production:** It gives a capitalist society some of the characteristics of a market.

**Other Features**

The basic relation of production in a capitalist society is one of a few controlling the means of production and the many without means of production, but only their labour power.

This is a relation of gross inequality of subordination and domination even of exploitation and antagonism.

This relation to the means of production as owners and non-owners is called a class relation. Those with no means of production constitute a class and those in control of the means of production, another class.

In this mode of production, the class of people who own and control the means of production are the bourgeoisie, while those without means of production, but have labour power, are the proletariat.

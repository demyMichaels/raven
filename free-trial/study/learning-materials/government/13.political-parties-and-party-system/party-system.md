            <h2>9.1 PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES</h2>
            <p>At the end of this chapter, students should be able to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Explain party system.</li>
                <li>Differentiate political parties and party system.</li>
                <li>Discuss the characteristics of different systems.</li>
                <li>Explain the merits and demerits of party system.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>9.2 PARTY SYSTEM</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Party system may be defined as the conduct of government based on the number of political parties within the system, for example, NPN, UPN, NPP, GNPP, PRP and NAP, the six political parties of the Second Republic (1979-83). The six political parties are an example of multi-party system. There are three types of party systems: one-party, two-party and multi-party systems.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="content-section one-party">
            <h2>9.3 ONE-PARTY OR SINGLE PARTY SYSTEM</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Single party may be defined as one in which only one legal and legitimate political party is constitutionally recognised in the country. No other party is recognised and can therefore not exist. A one-party system is a common feature of communist or socialist countries, for example, North Korea, Cuba and China. In Africa, Malawi, Kenya, Zambia, etc. were formerly one-party states.</p>
            
            <h3>Types of One-party System</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>True single-party system:</strong> The law effectively prevents the formation of any other active parties. By definition, this party system does not accept or permit opposition. This type of system was operative in Malawi, Zambia, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Hegemonic party:</strong> One party is firmly established in office. The party has hegemony, that is, it enjoys unchallenged authority. The law does not operate formally against any opposition, but clearly the state concerned is effectively single party for period of many years. For example, South Africa was an example of a hegemonic party (all - white electorate). The National Party came into power in 1948, and it only left power when Dr Nelson Mandela, was elected president in 1994.</li>
                <li><strong>Predominant party:</strong> This is a party which is elected and continues to be elected because the electorate so desire. This type of party is mostly found in Asian countries.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Characteristics of a One-party State</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>One officially recognised party: There is no other officially recognised political party, apart from the legally recognised party that can contest elections.</li>
                <li>Recognised by the constitution: Only this legal party is recognised by the constitution.</li>
                <li>No private control of the mass media: No private individual is allowed to own and publish newspaper, magazine, etc.</li>
                <li>One ideology: There is only one ideology for the country and it is for the party in government.</li>
                <li>Enforcement of government policies: The party in government ensures that all her policies and directives are strictly enforced.</li>
                <li>Opposition party: Opposition party is not legally recognised.</li>
                <li>Dictatorship: A one-party state can develop to become dictatorship.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>9.5 TWO-PARTY SYSTEM</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A two-party system may be defined as the existence of only two major political parties in a political system. These two parties are constitutionally recognised to contest elections. Britain is a good example of a two-party state. There are two major political parties – Labour and Conservative parties. Liberal party is a minor party. USA, Canada, Australia, etc. also practise a two-party system.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Two major political parties: There are only two major political parties that are legally and constitutionally recognised. However, there may be in existence more than two political parties contesting elections.</li>

            <h2>9.7 MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> It is defined as a system with more than two political parties are contesting for political power in a country. All the parties are duly registered and recognised by law. For example, Nigeria's Second Republic (1979-83) had six recognised political parties: NPN, UPN, NPP, GNPP, PRP and NAP. In a multi-party system, a coalition government may be formed, if no party had absolute majority seats in parliamentary election. However, coalition government is mostly common with parliamentary democracy. Nigeria, France, Italy, Zambia, Malawi, etc. practise multi-party systems.</p>

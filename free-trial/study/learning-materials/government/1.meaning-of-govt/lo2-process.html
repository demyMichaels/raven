GOVERNMENT AS A PROCESS
OR THE ART OF GOVERNING
Government is referred to as an art of governing
because it is a body vested with the supreme
power of the affairs of a state. 
A government is
vested with the power of maintaining peace and
security by putting in place machinery for that
purpose.

1.
Government makes laws and enforces
them on the people of that country. It
makes policies and implements them.
Equally, it interprets laws and punishes the
offenders. Mostofthe policies, and actions
taken are meant for the general well-being
of the society.

2
Government should be able to carry the
people along in most of the activities
embarked upon. 
The efficiency of govemment in the process of
administration is based on the principle of separation of
powers, where the organs of government
- the executive, the legislature and the
Judiciary - have their powers distinctly
separated both in functions and in
personnel. Each of the organs has its
functions defined by the constitution.

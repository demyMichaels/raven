            <h2>10.2 PRESSURE GROUP</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Pressure group is defined as organised groups, which influence government decisions socially or economically, without necessarily entering into election activities for the control of government. In doing this, they influence the executive, legislature and other officials of government to achieve their immediate aims. However, some have argued that pressure groups are part of the political process and that they attempt to reinforce or change the direction of government policy, but do not wish, as it were, to be in government.</p>

        <div class="section types">
            <h2>10.3 TYPES OF PRESSURE GROUPS</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Economic pressure groups:</strong> These are mostly manufacturers' associations like Chamber of Commerce, Cocoa Farmers Union, Cotton Producers Union, etc. They mount pressure on and at the same time influence the government whenever they have problems on issues affecting their members.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Professional pressure groups:</strong> They are organised professional associations like the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), etc. They can go on strike to press home their demands for an improved better condition of their members.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Educational pressure groups:</strong> These groups have to do with lecturers in colleges and higher institutions of learning, students and the non-academic staff of these institutions.</li>
                
                <div class="image-placeholder">

                </div>
                
                <p>These groups mount pressure on government for better conditions of service and for the qualitative funding of the education sector; they sometimes go on strikes to press home their demands.</p>
                
                <li><strong>Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC):</strong> All the trade unions in Nigeria are under this body. It is the parent body that officially represents the interests of the workers with the government. There are state chapters of NLC.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Promotional interest groups:</strong> This group is out to champion the cause for an improved condition of the people's welfare. This action may not necessarily benefit the members, but the less privileged in the society.

                <li><strong>Social pressure groups:</strong> They are generally out to promote the general welfare of their members. Some of these groups are Boys Scout, Girls Guide, Rotary Club, Old Boys Association, etc.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Religious pressure groups:</strong> These include Christians, Moslems, Traditionalists, etc. Most issues affecting them have been resolved through lobbying of the executive and the parliament.</li>

            <h2>10.7 DANGERS POSED BY THE ACTIVITIES OF PRESSURE GROUPS</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Political instability:</strong> This can result especially where the activities of pressure groups lead to the fall of government in power.</li>
                <li><strong>Social disorder:</strong> The activities of pressure groups may be accompanied by social disorder, e.g. riot, violent demonstrations, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>The majority may go unrepresented:</strong> Pressure groups may be taken to represent more general opinions or people which may not be so. Therefore, the majority of the general public may go unrepresented where they have interest.</li>
                <li><strong>Misrepresentation:</strong> There could be misrepresentation of public opinion by a vocal few to the government.</li>
                <li><strong>Misinformation of the general public:</strong> Pressure groups may disseminate wrong information through mass propaganda, thereby misinforming the general public.</li>
                <li><strong>Lobbying:</strong> Pressure groups may corrupt public officials by engaging in lobbying.</li>
                <li><strong>Strike action:</strong> It is two-edged. The company suffers a downturn; also the legitimate support of the people.</li>
                <li><strong>Negative effect on economy:</strong> The country's economy is affected by industrial actions.</li>
                <li><strong>They are self-centred:</strong> Pressure groups are self-centred. They are mostly vocal about issues affecting their members only.</li>
                <li><strong>Supporting a political party:</strong> The support given to a political party by pressure groups may produce a government that does not have the masses at heart.</li>

On 7th September, 1987, 46 members of CRC were constituted to use the findings of the political bureau as a basis for reviewing the 1963 and 1979 First and Second republics’ constitutions respectively. The CRC produced a constitution after the examination was carried out by the Constituent Assembly established on 11th May, 1988 with a membership of 452. The report was submitted to the administration of Babangida, with some amendments and later promulgated into law with a decree backing it up.

CONFEDERAL GOVERNMENT**

Definition: Confederation may be defined as a league of sovereign states with a loose political arrangement in which autonomous states come together to form a union. However, the functions of government are exclusively reserved for the component states with a weak centre. It is also seen as a voluntary association of sovereign states with a recognised authority in certain matters affecting the whole and especially in respect of external relations and with a common course of actions in specific areas like foreign affairs, defence, currency, etc.

In a confederation, there is no effective and viable central authority. The United Nations (UN), The African Union (AU), etc. have the picture of a confederation. The usual coming together of member states to discuss issues of mutual importance and to co-operate in some areas that will be of benefits to memberships to this fact. Other examples of confederacy are the 19th century German confederacy, American confederation of 1781 to 1789.

**Features of Confederal Government**
1. Consultations: This is made among them before taking independent actions.
2. Loose union: Confederation is a loose union of sovereign states.
3. No effective executive authority: Members only send delegates to the centre to discuss issues of common interest like defence, telecommunications, etc.
4. No national armed forces: The various members of the confederacy maintain and retain their separate military establishments.
5. Separate diplomatic representations: Member states have separate diplomatic representations.
6. Right of secession: Members have equal status and have the right of secession from the confederation, if and when the government of member states so desires.
7. Unstable political system: The break away of member states from the union can bring an end to the system.
8. Absence of effective central authority: This is because a sovereign power cannot be located in a confederation.
9. Membership of the union is voluntary: No member state is forced to become a member of the union, since they can see at any time.
10. Control over their internal affairs: The member states of the confederation have control over their internal affairs.
11. Constitution: The constitution may be seen as very accommodating to changes.
12. Sovereignty: Component states making up a confederal union still retain their sovereignty and identity.
13. Even development: The system does not make for even development.
14. Single government: Citizens have to obey only a single government and that is the government of their own states.

**Merits of Confederal Government**
1. Mutual benefits accruing to member states: Each member state benefits from one another in different areas of interest.
2. The union is voluntary: No member state was forced to become a member of the union since they can see at any time.
3. Control over their internal affairs: The component states have total control over their internal affairs.
4. Obedience to one government: Citizens have to obey only one government, that is, that of their own state.
5. Equality of states: Equality exists among the states making up the confederation. No state can claim superiority over others.
6. Consensus: Actions are taken by member states of a confederation based on the consensus earlier reached.

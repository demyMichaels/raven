Beyond user authentication, authorization, payment integration, and analytics, here are some other common and crucial features for web applications:

Domain and hosting: My project is currently hosted using Github Pages and namespace domain provider (I think)

User Analytics: This is currently provided by Google Analytics


User authentication
User authorization
Payment Integration


Database: I am considering Supabase and Firebase to manage my data, set up authentication, and create backend functions. 


User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX): Designing and implementing an intuitive, visually appealing, and easy-to-use interface for users to interact with the application.


Payment Integration: worldwide payment


Scalability: Designing the application to handle increasing numbers of users and data without significant performance degradation.

Database Management: The ability to store, retrieve, update, and delete data. 
This is fundamental for almost any web application to function. I'm currently using local stoage for testing.


API Integrations: Connecting with external services and platforms to extend functionality. 
This could include 
social media APIs, 
mapping services, 
communication platforms, or other 
third-party tools.
I'm not integrating for now.


Content Management System (CMS): For applications that involve dynamic content, a CMS allows for easy creation, editing, and publishing of content without requiring developer intervention.
This has to be adopted considering we are using a lot of content - videos, pictures, simulation.


Search Functionality: Enabling users to quickly find specific information or content within the application.


Notifications (Email, Push, In-App): Keeping users informed about important events, updates, or actions.


Error Handling and Logging: Implementing robust mechanisms to catch and manage errors, and to log system activities for debugging and auditing purposes.


Performance Monitoring: Tools and processes to track the speed, responsiveness, and overall health of the application, ensuring a smooth user experience.


Security Features (beyond Auth/Auth): This includes protection against common web vulnerabilities (like SQL injection, cross-site scripting), data encryption, and secure coding practices.


Deployment and DevOps Tools: Automating the process of getting the application from development to 
production, including continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).


Caching: Storing frequently accessed data temporarily to reduce database load and improve response times.


File Storage and Management: Allowing users to upload, store, and manage various types of files (images, documents, videos).


Internationalization and Localization: Supporting multiple languages and adapting the application to different cultural conventions for a global audience.

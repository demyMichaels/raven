The zygote soon become surrounded by a thick brown wall to become zygospore which bursts after a short rest and germinates to produce a new filament 3. The nuclei of the gametes fuse to form a zygote 4. The protuberances meet and where they touch the cell-wall disappears so that a conjugation tube joining the two cells is formed 5.

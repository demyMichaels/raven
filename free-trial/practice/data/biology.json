                            "explanation": "A tertiary consumer is an organism that feeds on a secondary consumer. In this food chain, the grasshopper is a **primary consumer** (eating the producer), the frog is a **secondary consumer** (eating the grasshopper), and the snake is a **tertiary consumer** because it eats the frog. The energy pyramid shows why there are fewer tertiary consumers than producers.",

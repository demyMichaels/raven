    "options": [
      "It translates genetic information for the manufacture of proteins",
      "it stores and carries hereditary information",
      "it is a reservoir of energy for the cell",
      "it controls the life processes of the cell"

    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The nucleus is responsible for storing genetic information and controlling cell activities, but it does not store energy; that is the role of mitochondria.",

      "answer": "A. Decreasing the length of the wire",
      "explanation": "Immersing the load in water provides an upthrust (buoyant force), which effectively reduces the tension (T) in the wire. Since frequency f ∝ √T, the frequency decreases. To restore the original frequency, we need to compensate for the decrease in T. Since f ∝ 1/L, decreasing the length L will increase the frequency, counteracting the effect of reduced tension."

The first resonance length L = λ/4 = 1.0 m / 4 = 0.25 m. The maximum height of water for the first resonance is the total tube height minus the air column length: 1.2m - 0.25m = 0.95m.

      "answer": "A. The man at point X will receive a lower pitch",
      "explanation": "This is the Doppler effect. The car is moving towards point X. For an observer towards whom the source is moving, the perceived pitch (frequency) is higher. For an observer away from whom the source is moving (like point Z), the perceived pitch is lower. The driver is moving with the source, so they hear the actual pitch. Option A is incorrect based on the Doppler effect; X should hear a higher pitch. The correct answer is likely E. None of the above, or C (Z hears a lower pitch).

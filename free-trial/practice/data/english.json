      "broke loose",

    ],
    "answer": "d",

      "off",
      "on"
    ],

    "answer": "a",

      "remanded",
      "locked out"
    ],
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "To be 'locked up' means to be confined or imprisoned. In a legal context, being held in custody for a short period, like a 'fortnight' (two weeks), often means being 'remanded', which is the technical legal term for holding someone in custody pending a further hearing or trial. It is the most specific and contextually deep synonym."

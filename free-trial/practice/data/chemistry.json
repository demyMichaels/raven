Key Takeaway: A co-ordinate bond forms when one atom donates both electrons to form a bond. Think of it as one-sided sharing."

    "explanation": "Potassium (K) has atomic number 19, meaning it has 19 electrons. Its electron configuration is 2,8,8,1. When it loses the single outermost electron to form K⁺, it becomes 2,8,8, which is exactly the same stable electron configuration as argon (Ar), a noble gas.

    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Both water (H₂O) and methanol (CH₃OH) have hydrogen bonds, which are strong intermolecular forces. However, each water molecule can form up to four hydrogen bonds (two through its hydrogen atoms and two through the oxygen's lone pairs), creating a strong network. Methanol can form fewer and slightly weaker hydrogen bonds. More energy is needed to break water's hydrogen bonds, so it boils at a higher temperature. Key Takeaway: The strength of intermolecular forces (like hydrogen bonding) determines physical properties like boiling point. More/better hydrogen bonds → higher boiling point."

For every one X²⁻ (needs 2+ charges), we need two Y⁺ ions (each provides 1+ charge). So formula is Y₂X. Key Takeaway: To find formula of ionic compound, swap the valencies and simplify.

    "explanation": "Electronegativity measures how strongly an atom pulls shared electrons toward itself. If one atom is much more electronegative than the other, it pulls the bonding electrons closer, creating a dipole (partial positive and negative ends). This makes the bond polar. Larger electronegativity difference = more polar bond. Example: NaCl (ΔEN large) is very polar/ionic; CCl₄ (ΔEN small) is non-polar.

    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Hydrogen bonding occurs when hydrogen is bonded to F, O, or N. The strength of hydrogen bonding depends on how electronegative the atom is. Fluorine (F) is the most electronegative element, so H-F bonds create the strongest hydrogen bonds. NH₃ has weaker hydrogen bonds, while CH₄ and HCl don't form significant hydrogen bonds at all. Key Takeaway: F > O > N for hydrogen bond strength. HF has the strongest hydrogen bonds despite being a gas at room temperature."

      "X",
      "W"
    ],
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "X is positioned as a non-metal with 4-7 valence electrons (like carbon or oxygen). Non-metals typically form covalent bonds by sharing electrons rather than transferring them. W is a metal (forms ionic bonds), Y can form both, and Z is a noble gas (doesn't bond at all).

    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "X²⁺ has lost 2 electrons. Since the ion has the configuration of argon (1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶), neutral X must have had 2 more electrons. In the filling order, after 3p⁶ comes 4s² before 3d orbitals. So neutral X is calcium (Ca) with configuration: 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 4s².

    "explanation": "Ionic character decreases as the metal becomes less electropositive (less willing to lose electrons). Aluminium is the least electropositive of these metals and has a high charge density (small size, +3 charge), which polarizes the chloride ions, making the bonds more covalent. This is Fajans' rule: small cation with high charge favors covalent character. Key Takeaway: Smaller cation with higher charge = more covalent character.

    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Gay-Lussac's Law (P ∝ T at constant volume) explains this phenomenon. When you compress air rapidly in the pump, the volume decreases but the process happens so quickly that heat can't escape easily (adiabatic process). The work done compressing the gas increases its internal energy, raising its temperature. Key Takeaway: Rapid compression increases temperature due to P ∝ T relationship at constant volume."

    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Potassium chlorate is KClO₃. Potassium (K) always has an oxidation state of +1. Oxygen (O) is usually -2, except in peroxides. Let Cl = x. Since the compound is neutral, the sum of oxidation states = 0. So: (+1) + x + 3(-2) = 0 → 1 + x - 6 = 0 → x = +5. Therefore, chlorine is +5 in KClO₃.\n\n🔑 **Key Takeaway:** For oxoanions, use the rule: Sum of oxidation numbers = charge. Oxygen is usually -2, except in peroxides."

Cl₂ also gains electrons to become Cl⁻, but Cl₂ is not an ion—it is a molecule. The question asks for an *ion*, so Fe³⁺ is the correct answer.\n\n🔑 **Key Takeaway:** Oxidizing agents are reduced; look for species that gain electrons. Watch out for wording—‘ion’ vs. ‘molecule’."

    "options": [
      "the initial slope of the curve is the steepest and this occurs when small pieces of marble are used and is due to small surface area of reactant",

    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Fermentation uses yeast enzymes to convert starch (after enzymatic breakdown to glucose) into ethanol and CO₂. Starch → (enzymes) → Glucose → (yeast) → Ethanol + CO₂. Distillation separates ethanol after fermentation but doesn't create it. Cracking breaks hydrocarbons, not carbohydrates. Cooking just heats starch."

    ],
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Hydrogenation means adding hydrogen to unsaturated compounds (alkenes or alkynes) using metal catalysts like nickel or platinum. Alkynes (C≡C) can add 2 molecules of H₂ to become alkanes. Alkanes are already saturated and don't add hydrogen. Removing hydrogen is dehydrogenation, not hydrogenation."

    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "At 145°C with excess ethanol, concentrated H₂SO₄ causes intermolecular dehydration: 2C₂H₅OH → C₂H₅–O–C₂H₅ (diethyl ether) + H₂O. At 170°C, intramolecular dehydration occurs: C₂H₅OH → C₂H₄ (ethene) + H₂O. Temperature controls the product: lower temp (145°C) gives ether, higher temp (170°C) gives alkene."

    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Hardening converts liquid unsaturated oils to semi-solid fats by hydrogenation: adding H₂ across C=C bonds using nickel catalyst. Unsaturated fatty acids have kinked chains (liquid); hydrogenation makes straight chains that pack tightly (solid). NaOH makes soap (saponification).

    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Conc. H₂SO₄ removes chemically combined water from sucrose: C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁ (sugar) → 12C + 11H₂O. The black mass is elemental carbon.

    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Oils (and fats) are triglycerides: esters formed by condensation of glycerol with three fatty acid molecules, releasing three water molecules.

    "explanation": "Calcium carbide (CaC₂) reacts with water to produce acetylene gas (C₂H₂): CaC₂ + 2H₂O → C₂H₂ + Ca(OH)₂. Acetylene burns with a sooty flame due to its high carbon content (92.3% carbon). Calcium produces hydrogen gas (burns with pale blue flame). Calcium oxide gives calcium hydroxide (no gas).

    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The non-isomer is the one with different molecular formula. Options A and B are C₄H₁₀O (butanol and ethoxyethane). Options C, D, E as written appear to be C₄H₁₀ (butane) or have different H counts. Isomers must have same molecular formula; C₄H₁₀ (alkane) cannot be isomer of C₄H₁₀O (alcohol/ether)."

    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Alkanes contain only carbon and hydrogen (hydrocarbons). They are not all gases (C₁–C₄ gases, C₅–C₁₇ liquids, C₁₈+ solids). General formula is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂ (but option says C₆H₂₀ₓO which is incorrect). Insoluble in water (nonpolar). Not very reactive (called paraffins = little affinity)."

    "options": ["a polymerization reaction", "an isomerization reaction", "an addition reaction", "a substitution reaction", "a reduction reaction"],
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Sunlight initiates free-radical substitution of alkanes with chlorine: RH + Cl₂ → RCl + HCl. The hydrocarbon is likely an alkane (liquid like hexane). Addition would require unsaturated hydrocarbon. Polymerization would form polymers. Isomerization rearranges. Reduction would add hydrogen."

    "options": ["serve as a dehydrating agent", "serve as a solvent", "act as a catalyst", "prevent any side reaction", "serve as an oxidizing agent"],
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Conc. H₂SO₄ primarily acts as a catalyst in esterification: it protonates the carboxylic acid, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by the alcohol. It also serves as dehydrating agent secondarily by removing water, shifting equilibrium toward ester. Not a solvent (ethanol is solvent), not oxidizing, doesn't prevent side reactions."

    "options": ["isopropylethene", "acetylene", "3-methylbutane", "2-methylbutane", "5-methylpentane"],
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "The compound is 2-methylbutane (common name: isopentane). Longest chain: 4 carbons (butane). Methyl on carbon 2. Numbering from end nearest branch gives lowest number. Isopropylethene would have double bond. Acetylene is C₂H₂. 3-methylbutane is incorrect numbering. 5-methylpentane would have 6 carbons."

    "options": ["Pink", "Purple", "Orange", "Blue-black", "Green"],
    "answer": "e",
    "explanation": "Acidified K₂Cr₂O₇ is orange (Cr⁶⁺). Ethanol oxidizes to ethanal then ethanoic acid, reducing Cr⁶⁺ (orange) to Cr³⁺ (green). This color change (orange→green) is the basis of breathalyzer tests. Pink might be KMnO₄ reduction. Purple is KMnO₄ color. Blue-black is starch-iodine. The green color indicates positive test for ethanol."

    ],
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "CH₃COCH₂CH₃ is butan-2-one (a ketone). Acid hydrolysis of ketones generally doesn't occur easily, but if forced, it would cleave to carboxylic acid + alcohol: CH₃COCH₂CH₃ + H₂O → CH₃COOH (ethanoic acid) + CH₃CH₂CH₂OH (propan-1-ol). This is reverse of ketone formation. The C=O becomes –OH on the smaller fragment."

    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₂OH is butan-1-ol (primary alcohol). Strong oxidation of primary alcohols gives carboxylic acids: butan-1-ol → butanal → butanoic acid. 2-Butanone would come from oxidation of butan-2-ol (secondary alcohol). Butane is the alkane. Butanal is the intermediate aldehyde. 3-Butanal doesn't exist (wrong numbering)."

    "explanation": "The compound is 4-methylpent-2-ene actually. Let's analyze: CH₃–CH(CH₃)–CH=CH–CH₃. Longest chain with double bond: 5 carbons (pentene). Double bond between C2-C3 (from one end) or C3-C4 (from other). Number from end nearest double bond: gives pent-2-ene. Methyl on C4: 4-methylpent-2-ene. Among options, 2-methyl-3-pentene is close but numbering should give double bond lowest number."

    "options": ["a carboxylic acid", "an alkane", "an alkene", "an alkyne", "an alkanone"],
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Alkenes decolorize acidified KMnO₄ (oxidation to diols then cleavage) but don't react with ammoniacal AgNO₃ (which tests for terminal alkynes with acidic H). Alkynes with terminal H give white precipitate of silver acetylide. Alkanes don't react with either. Carboxylic acids may react with KMnO₄ only under strong conditions.

    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Carboxylic acids have the –COOH functional group (carboxyl group). –OH alone is alcohol. >C=O is carbonyl (in ketones, aldehydes). >C–OH is incorrect notation. –C≡N is nitrile. The carboxyl group combines carbonyl and hydroxyl but has distinct acidic properties due to resonance stabilization of the conjugate base."

    "options": ["an alkene", "an alkane", "an alkyne", "tetrachloromethane", "dichloromethane"],
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "X is an alkane (saturated hydrocarbon). Alkanes burn completely to CO₂ (Y, turns limewater milky) and H₂O (Z, turns white anhydrous CuSO₄ blue). They don't decolorize bromine (saturated). Alkenes/alkynes decolorize Br₂. Chloromethanes produce HCl gas when burned, not just CO₂ + H₂O."

    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Complete combustion of hydrocarbon (alkane) gives CO₂ (turns limewater milky: Ca(OH)₂ + CO₂ → CaCO₃↓ + H₂O) and H₂O (turns anhydrous CuSO₄ from white to blue: CuSO₄ + 5H₂O → CuSO₄·5H₂O).

    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Oil (unsaturated liquid) → margarine (more saturated semi-solid) by hydrogenation: adding H₂ across C=C bonds using Ni catalyst at 150-200°C.

    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "After saponification, adding NaCl (salting out) causes soap to precipitate out due to reduced solubility in brine, separating it from glycerol in solution. NaCl doesn't react with glycerol. Purification occurs by recrystallization. Decomposition is by NaOH, not NaCl. Fatty acids are already converted to sodium salts by NaOH."

    ],
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Vulcanization (Charles Goodyear, 1839) adds sulfur to natural rubber (polyisoprene). Sulfur forms cross-links (disulfide bridges) between polymer chains, making rubber stronger, more elastic, and less sticky. It doesn't catalyze polymerization (that already happened). Rubber becomes thermoset, not thermoplastic. Doesn't break down or shorten chains."

    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Palm-oil (triglyceride) + potash (KOH) → soap (potassium salt of fatty acid) + glycerol. This is saponification (alkaline hydrolysis). Foaming indicates soap formation (surfactant properties). Neutralization would be acid + base. Etherification makes ethers. Salting-out precipitates soap after saponification."

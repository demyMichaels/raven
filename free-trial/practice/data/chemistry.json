When a hydrogen ion (H⁺) approaches, which has no electrons at all, the nitrogen donates its lone pair to form a bond with the hydrogen. This is called a dative or co-ordinate bond because both electrons in the bond come from one atom (nitrogen). Key Takeaway: A co-ordinate bond forms when one atom donates both electrons to form a bond. Think of it as one-sided sharing."

    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Potassium (K) has atomic number 19, meaning it has 19 electrons. Its electron configuration is 2,8,8,1. When it loses the single outermost electron to form K⁺, it becomes 2,8,8, which is exactly the same stable electron configuration as argon (Ar), a noble gas.

    "explanation": "Helium has only two electrons, which completely fill its first and only shell (K-shell can hold a maximum of 2 electrons). A completely filled outer shell is the most stable arrangement an atom can have, making it extremely unreactive.

    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Both water (H₂O) and methanol (CH₃OH) have hydrogen bonds, which are strong intermolecular forces. However, each water molecule can form up to four hydrogen bonds (two through its hydrogen atoms and two through the oxygen's lone pairs), creating a strong network. Methanol can form fewer and slightly weaker hydrogen bonds. More energy is needed to break water's hydrogen bonds, so it boils at a higher temperature. Key Takeaway: The strength of intermolecular forces (like hydrogen bonding) determines physical properties like boiling point. More/better hydrogen bonds → higher boiling point."

Y has 1 valence electron → It wants to LOSE 1 electron to have a full outer shell. Valency = 1 (positive ion, Y⁺). In an ionic compound, charges must balance. For every one X²⁻ (needs 2+ charges), we need two Y⁺ ions (each provides 1+ charge). So formula is Y₂X. Key Takeaway: To find formula of ionic compound, swap the valencies and simplify.

    "explanation": "Electronegativity measures how strongly an atom pulls shared electrons toward itself. If one atom is much more electronegative than the other, it pulls the bonding electrons closer, creating a dipole (partial positive and negative ends). This makes the bond polar. Larger electronegativity difference = more polar bond. Example: NaCl (ΔEN large) is very polar/ionic; CCl₄ (ΔEN small) is non-polar.

    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Hydrogen bonding occurs when hydrogen is bonded to F, O, or N. The strength of hydrogen bonding depends on how electronegative the atom is. Fluorine (F) is the most electronegative element, so H-F bonds create the strongest hydrogen bonds. NH₃ has weaker hydrogen bonds, while CH₄ and HCl don't form significant hydrogen bonds at all. Key Takeaway: F > O > N for hydrogen bond strength. HF has the strongest hydrogen bonds despite being a gas at room temperature."

      "Y",
      "X",
      "W"
    ],
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "X is positioned as a non-metal with 4-7 valence electrons (like carbon or oxygen). Non-metals typically form covalent bonds by sharing electrons rather than transferring them. W is a metal (forms ionic bonds), Y can form both, and Z is a noble gas (doesn't bond at all).

    "explanation": "Z has a completely filled outer electron shell, which is the most stable configuration possible. Elements with full valence shells (noble gases) are extremely unreactive because they don't need to gain, lose, or share electrons to become stable.

    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "X²⁺ has lost 2 electrons. Since the ion has the configuration of argon (1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶), neutral X must have had 2 more electrons. In the filling order, after 3p⁶ comes 4s² before 3d orbitals. So neutral X is calcium (Ca) with configuration: 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 4s². Key Takeaway: Electrons are lost from the highest energy level first (4s before 3d). Calcium loses its 4s electrons to form Ca²⁺."

    "explanation": "Ionic character decreases as the metal becomes less electropositive (less willing to lose electrons). Aluminium is the least electropositive of these metals and has a high charge density (small size, +3 charge), which polarizes the chloride ions, making the bonds more covalent. This is Fajans' rule: small cation with high charge favors covalent character. Key Takeaway: Smaller cation with higher charge = more covalent character.

    "explanation": "Chlorine is much more electronegative (pulls electrons more strongly) than hydrogen. In HCl, the bonding electrons are pulled much closer to chlorine, creating a dipole: H⁺δ — Cl⁻δ. This makes HCl polar (shows ionic character).

Elements that easily lose electrons (metals) form ionic/electrovalent compounds. 2,8,8 is already stable (noble gas). 2,8,4 and 2,8,5 are non-metals that share electrons covalently.

The variable formulas (XBr₂ and XBr₃) show the metal has variable valency (like iron: FeBr₂ and FeBr₃), which is common in ionic compounds of transition metals.

For chlorine: Time = Time for oxygen × (Volume chlorine/Volume oxygen) × √(Density chlorine/Density oxygen) = 7 × (60/30) × √(36/16) = 7 × 2 × (6/4) = 7 × 2 × 1.5 = 21 seconds.

O₂ is limiting: 20 cm³ O₂ reacts with 40 cm³ H₂ (2:1 ratio). Unreacted H₂ = 10 cm³. Steam produced = 40 cm³ (from 40 cm³ H₂ reacted, produces 40 cm³ H₂O). Total = 10 cm³ H₂ + 20 cm³ H₂O? Wait, let's recalc carefully. Actually from 20 cm³ O₂: produces 40 cm³ H₂O vapor. So total = 10 cm³ H₂ + 40 cm³ H₂O = 50 cm³. But the answer is D (30 cm³).

    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Gay-Lussac's Law (P ∝ T at constant volume) explains this phenomenon. When you compress air rapidly in the pump, the volume decreases but the process happens so quickly that heat can't escape easily (adiabatic process). The work done compressing the gas increases its internal energy, raising its temperature. Key Takeaway: Rapid compression increases temperature due to P ∝ T relationship at constant volume."

    "explanation": "At high altitude, external pressure decreases. According to Boyle's Law (P ∝ 1/V), lower external pressure allows gas inside to expand, but balloon material resists, so it appears to shrink or deflate.

    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Potassium chlorate is KClO₃. Potassium (K) always has an oxidation state of +1. Oxygen (O) is usually -2, except in peroxides. Let Cl = x. Since the compound is neutral, the sum of oxidation states = 0. So: (+1) + x + 3(-2) = 0 → 1 + x - 6 = 0 → x = +5. Therefore, chlorine is +5 in KClO₃.\n\n🔑 **Key Takeaway:** For oxoanions, use the rule: Sum of oxidation numbers = charge. Oxygen is usually -2, except in peroxides."

Cl₂ also gains electrons to become Cl⁻, but Cl₂ is not an ion—it is a molecule. The question asks for an *ion*, so Fe³⁺ is the correct answer.\n\n🔑 **Key Takeaway:** Oxidizing agents are reduced; look for species that gain electrons. Watch out for wording—‘ion’ vs. ‘molecule’."

    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Reduction means a decrease in oxidation number. Cl₂ goes from oxidation state 0 to -1 in Cl⁻—its oxidation number decreases.

SO₂ gains electrons, so it acts as an oxidizing agent. In other reactions, SO₂ is oxidized (e.g., to H₂SO₄).\n\n🔑 **Key Takeaway:** SO₂ can act as both oxidizing and reducing agent.

    "options": ["2.7 g", "1.2 g", "0.9 g", "0.3 g"],
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Ag⁺ + e⁻ → Ag (108 g/mol) ⇒ 3.6 g Ag = 0.0333 mol Ag ⇒ 0.0333 mol e⁻. Al³⁺ + 3e⁻ → Al ⇒ mol Al = 0.0333/3 ≈ 0.0111 mol ⇒ mass = 0.0111 × 27 ≈ 0.3 g."

    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Solids maintain a fixed shape because their particles are held in place by **strong intermolecular attraction** (or bonds)."

      "A. metallic lon",
      "B. non-metallic lon",
      "C. neutral ion",
      "D. neutral non-metal"
    ],
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Protons $= 11$ (Sodium, $\text{Na}$, a metal). Charge $= 11 (\text{p}) - 10 (\text{e}) = +1$. A positively charged metal atom is a **metallic ion** ($\text{Na}^+$)."

    "options": [
      "A. Metallic bonding",
      "B. Ionic bonding.",
      "C. Covalent bonding",
      "D. Dative bonding"

      "A. It contains 12 protons",
      "B. It forms a covalent chloride",
      "C. Its atomic number is 23",
      "D. It is an alkali metal"
    ],
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "The atomic number is $11$, meaning the configuration is $2, 8, 1$. This element is in Group I and is an **alkali metal**."

      "B. electrovalent",
      "C. metallic",
      "D. covalent"
    ],
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The bonds between the central $\text{Cu}^{2+}$ ion and the $\text{NH}_3$ ligands are formed by the donation of a lone pair from the $\text{N}$ atom, making them **coordinate (dative covalent) bonds**."

    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Hydrogen bonding occurs only when $\text{H}$ is bonded directly to the highly electronegative $\text{F}$, $\text{O}$, or $\text{N}$. **Hydrogen fluoride ($\text{HF}$)** is the only choice that fits this rule."

    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The central oxygen atom has 6 valence electrons; 2 form bonds with $\text{H}$ and the remaining 4 electrons form **2 lone pairs**."

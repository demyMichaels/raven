      "explanation": "1. First, write the formula: KClO₃.\n2. We know potassium (K) is always +1 in compounds.\n3. Oxygen (O) is usually -2. We have 3 oxygen atoms: 3 × (-2) = -6.\n4. The whole compound has no charge (it's neutral), so all oxidation numbers must add up to 0.\n5. Let chlorine's oxidation state = x.\n6. Equation: (+1) + x + (-6) = 0 → 1 + x - 6 = 0 → x - 5 = 0 → x = +5.\nKey takeaway: In KClO₃, chlorine is +5. Remember: Chlorate means +5. Hypochlorite = +1, Chlorite = +3, Perchlorate = +7."

      "answer": "c",
      "explanation": "1. An oxidizing agent makes other substances lose electrons (get oxidized) while itself gains electrons (gets reduced).\n2. Look at Fe²⁺: It becomes Fe³⁺ → loses an electron → gets oxidized → is a reducing agent.\n3. Look at Cl₂: It becomes Cl⁻ → gains an electron → gets reduced → is an oxidizing agent, BUT Cl₂ is a molecule, not an ion.\n4. The question asks for 'ion' as oxidizing agent: Fe³⁺ doesn't change here, but it could accept electrons to become Fe²⁺ in other reactions, so it can behave as an oxidizing agent.\nKey takeaway: Oxidizing agents are reduced (gain electrons).

Zinc: From 0 to +2 → loses electrons → is oxidized.\n4. Reduction and oxidation always happen together in redox reactions.\nKey takeaway: In displacement reactions, the metal ion gets reduced (gains electrons) and the solid metal gets oxidized (loses electrons).

Cl goes from 0 to -1: oxidation number decreases by 1 (from 0 to -1) → reduction.\n3. Fe goes from +2 to +3: oxidation number increases by 1 → oxidation.\n4. Reduction means oxidation number decreases.\nKey takeaway: The best definition: Reduction = decrease in oxidation number. Always pick options mentioning oxidation number change."

Electrons flow FROM zinc (where they're produced) TO copper ions (where they're used).\n5.

Aluminium (0 → +3): oxidized (loses electrons)\n5. Iron (Fe²⁺ → Fe): reduced (gains electrons)\n6.

      "explanation": "1. Calculate oxidation numbers:\n   - K: +1 (always)\n   - Cr: +6 (as calculated earlier)\n   - O: -2 (always in normal compounds)\n2. +6 (Cr) > +1 (K) > -2 (O)\n3. So chromium has highest oxidation state\nKey takeaway: Transition metals often have the highest oxidation states in compounds. Here Cr(+6) is highest."

      "question": "In Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl₂ + H₂, which substance is reduced?",
      "options": ["Zn", "HCl", "ZnCl₂", "H₂"],
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "1. Check oxidation numbers:\n   - Zn: 0 → +2 (oxidized)\n   - H in HCl: +1 → H₂: 0 (reduced)\n2. The H⁺ in HCl gains electrons to become H₂\n3. So HCl (specifically the H⁺ in it) is reduced\nKey takeaway: In metal-acid reactions, H⁺ is reduced to H₂. The acid (HCl) provides the H⁺ that gets reduced."

      "options": ["-3", "-2", "+3", "+5"],
      "answer": "a",
      "explanation": "1. NH₄⁺ = ammonium ion\n2. H in compounds (except hydrides) = +1\n3. Let N = x\n   Total charge = +1\n   Equation: x + 4(+1) = +1\n   x + 4 = 1\n   x = 1 - 4 = -3\n4. Nitrogen is -3 in ammonium\nKey takeaway: In ammonium (NH₄⁺) and ammonia (NH₃), nitrogen is -3. The +1 charge on NH₄⁺ doesn't change N's oxidation state."

      "answer": "a",
      "explanation": "1. Check oxidation numbers:\n   - Na: 0 → +1 (oxidized)\n   - Cl: 0 → -1 (reduced)\n2. Na is oxidized → reducing agent\n3. Cl₂ is reduced → oxidizing agent\nKey takeaway: Alkali metals (Na, K, Li) are strong reducing agents. They easily lose electrons."

      "explanation": "1. Check oxidation numbers:\n   - H₂: H is 0\n   - H₂O: H is +1\n   - H goes from 0 to +1: oxidized\n2. Substance that is oxidized = reducing agent\n3. So H₂ is the reducing agent\nKey takeaway: Hydrogen gas (H₂) is a reducing agent. It reduces metal oxides to metals."

Check oxidation number changes:\n   A: Hg goes +2 to 0, O goes -2 to 0 → redox\n   B: Zn goes 0 to +2, Cu goes +2 to 0 → redox\n   C: All ions keep same charges: Ag⁺ stays +1, Na⁺ stays +1, Cl⁻ stays -1, NO₃⁻ stays -1 → NOT redox\n   D: H goes 0 to +1, O goes 0 to -2 → redox\nKey takeaway: Precipitation reactions (like AgNO₃ + NaCl) are NOT redox. All ions keep their charges."

      "explanation": "1. Reducing agent:\n   - Loses electrons (not gains)\n   - Gets oxidized (not reduced)\n   - Oxidation number increases\n   - Causes reduction in others\n2.

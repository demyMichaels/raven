We need to receive payment from users via Paystack and pay out referral rewards automatically.
Here's a high-level overview of how to implement this:

1. **Receiving Payments via Paystack:**
   - Integrate Paystack's payment gateway into your app.
   - When a user makes a payment, use Paystack's API to process the transaction.
   - Store transaction details in your Firebase database for record-keeping and future reference.
   * I can see transaction details in my Paystack dashboard 
   - You should also be able to view the transactions in the the raven admin dashboard/backend.  


2. **Tracking Referrals:**
   - When a user signs up, check if they were referred by another user 
   (e.g., via a referral code or link).
   - Store the referral relationship in your Firebase database or csv 


3. **Crediting Referral Rewards:**
   - When a referred user makes a payment, calculate the referral reward based on your defined structure (e.g., a percentage of the payment).
   - Credit the referrer's account with the reward amount in your database.


4. **Withdrawing Earnings:**
   - Allow users to request withdrawals of their earned referral rewards.
   - Implement a withdrawal request system where users can specify their bank details.
   - Use paystack api to confirm accuracy of the bank account.
   - provide details so they can reach out to customer suuport in case request breaks down for high figures


5. **Paying Out Referral Rewards via Paystack:**
   - When a user requests a withdrawal, use Paystack's Transfer API to send the referral reward to the user's bank account.
   - Ensure to handle any errors or issues that may arise during the payout process.            







For automatic payouts, you'll need a backend server to:

- Call Paystack Transfer API to send money to referrers
- Verify users provided bank account details using Paystack's Resolve Account endpoint
- Handle webhooks for payment confirmations

The app tracks referrals, 
credits earnings automatically when a referred user subscribes, 
and provides a clear withdrawal flow.

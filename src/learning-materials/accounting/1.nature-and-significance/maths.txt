Introduction

# Concepts and types of number bases
A number base is the number of digits in a given counting system. 
For instance, in our standard decimal base (that is, in standard base-10 number system), 
we have ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,  8, and 9.

On the other hand, in the octal system (that is, in the base-8 system), 
there is no digit eight "8" in the octal system.

And in the hexadecimal system (that is, in the base-16 system), 
there are sixteen digits: 0 through 9, followed by A, B, C,D , E, and F.


 #Conversion in number bases
 What are other number bases called?
 We use the decimal number bases, having ten digits; other number bases have their own names.
 For instance, the base-11 number base is called the "undecimal" base; base-12 is called "dozenal" as in "it has 
 a dozen digits").
 The base-8 system is called "octal"; the base-16 system is called "hexadecimal"; the base-2 system is called
 "binary". Other number base systems have distinct names, too, and many other systems have been used, and some still to this
 day are still used by various cultures and in various contexts.

 Digits versus numbers
 In our customary base-ten system, we have digits for the numbers zero through nine. We do not have a single-digit numeral for "ten"
 The Romans did, in their character "X". Yes, we can write the number "10", but this stands for "1 ten and 0 ones". this is two digits - a 1 and a 0. we have no single

Application
While the topic of different bases may seem somewhat pointless  to you, the rise of computers and computer graphics
has increased the need for knowledge of how to work with different, non-decimal base systems, particularly the binary system (consisting of just ones and zeroes) 
and the hexadecimal system.

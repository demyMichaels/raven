                    SOMETHING seemed unusual in the way the principal walked to the podium from the back of the assembly. He moved his tall frame rather ponderously. He was not as smart as he used to be. The trademark morning smile was not forthcoming. He took the microphone from Angel, the chapel prefect, and held it, saying nothing. This was in spite of the fact that the morning's pep talk was over, and everyone was excited. All waited for the principal to speak.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But the man looked blankly above the students' heads, instead of compellingly into their eyes, the way he used to. He made an attempt to talk; yet words did not come. His head dropped over his broad shoulders as he began to stare at the colourful tiles on the floor. There was a heavy silence. The principal, again, attempted to speak. Tears! Everyone saw them. Tears trickled out of his eyes.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    He made yet another attempt to produce words. This time, the microphone dropped on the floor, sending a vexatious clatter out of the twin sound boxes at the assembly. More tears streamed from both eyes, competitively rolling down his sunken cheeks. Dozens of perplexed eyes—students' and staff's—fixed on him. There was nowhere to hide from the puzzled looks.
                </p>
                
                <p class="border-l-4 border-accent-500 pl-6 py-2 bg-accent-50 dark:bg-accent-900/20 italic">
                    Then Mr. Bepo Adewale hid in the only available space. He brought his palms together, like a supplicant, and shielded his face.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The first person who found a voice was the Vice Principal, Mrs. Grace Apeh. "What is the matter, principal?" she asked, moving to his side. Four other members of staff joined her. But the principal said nothing. Instead, he sobbed freely. The school nurse, Mrs. Titi, fetched a handkerchief and offered it to the weeper.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    "Please, conclude the assembly and let the students go into their classes immediately," the VP instructed the Chemistry teacher, Mr. Justus Anabel. Mrs. Apeh, the nurse, and Mr. Oyelana, the CRK teacher, started walking the principal back to his office, his face still buried in his palms, sobbing, even more agitatedly.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    "Sir, what is the matter," Mrs. Titi – or Nurse Titi, as she was fondly called-asked, as they helped Bepo to his chair in the office. "Is anything the matter?" she asked again. Bepo did not utter a word. The tears did not stop flowing either.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    At 8:05am, more teachers arrived to console the sobbing principal or possibly lend a helping hand. But the VP advised they go to their classes, exempting the guidance counsellor, Mrs. Beke Egbin.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Consolations and questions resumed. For over 30 minutes, they petted Bepo, All the while, he sobbed. Occasionally, he would shake his head. He would look at the ceiling and at the faces before him, as though he had just returned from a dreamy wonderland. Then he would plunge further in tears.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The VP's phone, meanwhile, had been ringing. Information had already reached some parents. They were anxious to know what had happened to the beloved principal. One parent 'learnt' he was weeping uncontrollably and rolling on the floor. Another parent 'heard' that he kept muttering, 'Oluwa gba mi o!' Save me, O God!
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    At this point, Mrs. Apeh realised the best she could do was to call the Managing Director, Mrs. Ibidun Gloss, popularly called MD, who—but for a function she had to attend that morning—ought to have been in school.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But the morning assembly had not begun on a tearful note. Since the management of Stardom Schools came up with a shrewd incentive of lowering its boarding fees, the headache it used to have, trying to tame lateness, had reduced greatly. From N250,000 per session, the fee climbed down to N165,000. The result was instant: more than 80 per cent of the parents moved their children to the boarding house, which was a haven of modest comfort enjoyed by elite students.

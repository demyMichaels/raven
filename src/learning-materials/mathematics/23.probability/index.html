Probability
Do you always come to a complete stop when approaching a stop sign? 
Although we all know that we should, many of us rarely make a complete stop at stop signs.

In a survey conducted by Consumer Reports, 17% of men and 13% of women indicated 
that they often just slow down before proceeding through a stop sign. 

On the other hand, 42% of men and 56% of women surveyed said that they always stop at a 
stop sign. (See Case Study 4–1.)

We often make statements about probability. For example, a weather forecaster may predict that there
is an 80% chance of rain tomorrow. A health news reporter may state that a smoker has a much greater
chance of getting cancer than does a nonsmoker. A college student may ask an instructor about the
chances of passing a course or getting an A if he or she did not do well on the midterm examination.

Probability, which measures the likelihood that an event will occur, is an important part of statistics.
It is the basis of inferential statistics, which will be introduced in later chapters. In inferential statistics,
we make decisions under conditions of uncertainty. Probability theory is used to evaluate the uncertainty
involved in those decisions. For example, estimating next year’s sales for a company is based
on many assumptions, some of which may happen to be true and others may not. Probability theory
will help us make decisions under such conditions of imperfect information and uncertainty.
Combining probability and probability distributions (which are discussed in Chapters 5 through 7) with
descriptive statistics will help us make decisions about populations based on information obtained
from samples. This chapter presents the basic concepts of probability and the rules for computing
probability.

Experimental Probability
Quality control inspector Jack Cook of Tennis Products Company 
picks up a tennis ball from the production line to 
check whether it is good or defective. 

Cook’s act of inspecting a tennis ball is an example of a statistical experiment. 

The result of his inspection will be that the ball is either “good” or “defective.” 

Each of these two observations is called an outcome 
(also called a basic or final outcome) of the experiment, 
and these outcomes taken together constitute the
sample space for this experiment.
Experiment, Outcomes, and Sample Space 
An experiment is a process that, when performed,
results in one and only one of many observations.
These observations are called the outcomes of
the experiment. 
The collection of all outcomes for an experiment is called a sample space.
A sample space is denoted by S. 

The sample space for the example of inspecting a tennis
ball is written as
S = {good, defective}
Remember {}??
This reads “a set containing elements good and defective.
The elements of a sample space are called sample points.
Let’s show some experiments, their outcomes, and their sample spaces.
Experiment = Toss a coin once 
Possible Outcomes = Head, tail
Sample Space = S= {Head, Tail}

Next canvas 
Experiment = Roll a die once (let’s roll a die once) (user is then instructed to click the button to roll a die)
Possible Outcomes = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (user is told that the possible outcomes are 1,2,3…)
Sample Space = S = {1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6} (user is told that this means the sample space is a set of 1,2,3,4,5 and 6)(also reminded that the brackets symbolized by {} represents a set of ….)

Next canvas 
Experiment = Toss a coin twice 
Possible outcomes are Head & Head, Head & Tail, Tail & Head, Tail & Tail
Sample Space = {HH, HT, TH, TT}

Next canvas  
Experiment = Let’s assume we wasn’t to Play lottery
Possible outcomes are? Win or Lose 
This makes our sample space? S = {Win, Lose}

Next canvas 
Experiment = Our next experiment will be you taking a test
Possible outcomes are? You either pass or fail
This makes our sample space? S = {Pass, Fail}



Next canvas 
Select a worker
Male, Female
S = {Male, Female}
Now let’s talk about Venn Diagrams. Remember we talked about possible outcomes for our experiments, this can be depicted using Venn diagrams or tree diagrams.
A Venn diagram is a picture (a closed geometric shape such as a rectangle,
a square, or a circle) that depicts all the possible outcomes for an experiment.

In a tree diagram,
each outcome is represented by a branch of the tree. 
Venn and tree diagrams help us understand probability concepts by presenting them visually.

Examples 4–1 through 4–3 describe how to 
draw these diagrams for statistical experiments.



Let’s show an example
We are to draw the venn and tree diagrams for the experiment of tossing a coin once.
We know the experiment has two possible outcomes: head and tail.
Consequently, the sample space is given by
S = {H, T}, where H = Head and T = Tail
draw_venn_diagram()
Note: Can we make this interactive or there’s no need?
 
To draw a Venn diagram for this example, we draw a rectangle and mark two points
inside this rectangle that represent the two outcomes, Head and Tail. 
The rectangle is
labeled S because it represents the sample space (see Figure 4.1a).
To draw a tree diagram, we draw two branches starting at the same point, one representing the head and the second
representing the tail. 
The two final outcomes are listed at the ends of the branches (see
Figure 4.1b).

 


Now let’s draw the Venn and tree diagrams for the experiment of tossing a coin twice.
Solution
This experiment can be split into two parts:
The first toss and the second toss.
Suppose that the first time the coin is tossed, we obtain a head.
Then, on the second toss, we can still obtain a head or a tail.

Suppose we randomly select two workers from a company
(how many workers are in the company)

Worker 1= emoji
Worker 2 = emoji of worker

and observe whether the worker selected each time 
is a man or a woman.

Write all the outcomes for this experiment.
Draw the Venn and tree diagrams for this experiment.


Solution
Let us denote the selection of a man by M 
and that of a woman by W. 

We can compare the selection of two workers to two tosses of a coin. 
Just as each toss of a coin can result in one of two outcomes, head or tail, each selection from the workers of this company can result in one of two outcomes, man or woman. 

As we can see from the Venn and tree diagrams 
of Figure 4.3, there are four final outcomes: 
MM, 
MW, 
WM, 
WW.

Hence, the sample space is written as
S = {MM, MW, WM, WW}
 

NEXT MODULE

SIMPLE AND COMPOUND EVENTS
An event consists of one or more outcomes of an experiment.
An event may be a simple event or a compound event.

Simple Event: 
Each of the final outcomes for an experiment is called a simple event. i.e. they include one and only one outcome.
Usually, simple events are denoted by E1, E2, E3 and so forth.
However, we can denote them by any other letter – that is, by A, B, C and so forth.



Here is an example that describes simple events.
Reconsider the example on -selecting 2 workers from a company-  and observing whether the worker selected each time is a man or a woman. 
Each of the final four outcomes 
(MM, MW, WM and WW) for this experiment is a simple event.
These four events can be demoted by E1, E2, E3, and E4 respectively.
Thus 
E1 = (MM)
E2 = (MW)
E3 = (WM)
E4 = (WW)


COMPOUND EVENT
This event consists of more than one outcome.
Compound event is a collection of more than one outcome for an experiment.
Compound events are denoted by A, B, C, D, … or by A1, A2, A3, …. B1, B2, B3,… and so forth.



Example 4.5

Reconsider Example 4–3 on selecting two workers from a company and observing whether the
worker selected each time is a man or a woman. 

Let A be the event that at most one man is selected.

Event A will occur if either no man or one man is selected. Hence, the event A is given by
A = {MW, WM, WW}
Because event A contains more than one outcome, it is a compound event.
The Venn diagram gives a graphic presentation of compound event A
 

Because event A contains more than one outcome, it is a compound event. The Venn diagram
in Figure 4.4 gives a graphic presentation of compound event A.


EXAMPLE 
In a group of people, some are in favor of genetic engineering and others are against it. 
Two persons are selected at random from this group and asked whether they are in favor of or
against genetic engineering.

How many distinct outcomes are possible? 

Draw a Venn diagram and a tree diagram for this experiment. 

List all the outcomes included in each of the following events 
and state whether they are simple or compound events.

(a) Both persons are in favor of genetic engineering.
(b) At most one person is against genetic engineering.
(c) Exactly one person is in favor of genetic engineering.

Solution
Let F = a person is in favor of genetic engineering
A = a person is against engineering
This experiment has the following four outcomes:
FF = both persons are in favor of genetic engineering
FA = the first person is in favor and the second is against
AF = the first person is against and the second is in favor
AA = both persons are against genetic engineering

The Venn and tree diagrams in figure 4.5 show these four outcomes.

 

a.The event “both persons are in favor of genetic engineering” will occur if FF is obtained. Thus
Both persons are in favor of genetic engineering = {FF}

b. The event “at most one person is against genetic engineering” will occur if either none or one of the persons selected is against genetic engineering. Consequently
At most one person is against genetic engineering = {FF, FA, AF}
Because this event includes more than one outcome, it is a compound event.

c.	The event “exactly one person is in favor of genetic engineering” will occur if one of the two persons selected is in favor and other is against engineering. Hence, it includes the following two outcomes:
Exactly one person is in favor of genetic engineering = {FA, AF}
Because this event includes more than one outcome, it is a compound event.

SECTION 2: CALCULATING PROBABILITY
Probability, which gives the likelihood of occurrence of an event, is denoted by P. 

The probability that a simple event Ei will occur is denoted by P(Ei), 

and the probability that a compound event A will occur is denoted by P(A).

Probability is a numerical measure of the likelihood that a specific event will occur.

1.	The probability of an event always lies in the range 0 to 1.

Whether it is a simple or a compound event, the probability of an event is never less than 0 or greater than 1. 

Using mathematical notation, we can write this property as follows. (this is why we use sigmoid function in neural networks to convert outputs of the network to a number between 0 and 1).

First property of probability: 
0 <= P(Ei) <= 1
0 <= P(A) <= 1

An event that cannot has zero probability; such an event is called an impossible event. 
Ann event that is certain to occur has a probability equal to 1 and is called a sure event.
That is,
For an impossible event M: P(M) = 0
For a sure event C : P(C) = 1

2.	The sum of the probabilities of all simple events (or final outcomes) for an experiment, denoted by EP(Ei) is always 1

Second Property of Probability

For an experiment,
EP(Ei) = P(Ei) = P(E2) + P(E3) + … = 1


From this property, for the experiment of one toss of a coin,
P(H) + P(T) = 1

For the experiment of two tosses of a coin, 
P(HH) + P(HT) + P(TH) + P(TT) = 1

For the game of a football,
P(Win) + P(Lose) + P(Tie) = 1









SECTION 3
Three Conceptual Approaches to Probability
a.	Classical 
b.	Relative frequency
c.	Subjective probability

Classical Probability
Many times, various outcomes for an experiment may have the same probability of occurrence.
Such outcomes are called equally likely outcomes. 

The classical probability rule is applied to
compute the probabilities of events for an experiment for which all outcomes are equally likely.
According to the classical probability rule, the probability of a simple event is equal to 1
divided by the total number of outcomes for the experiment. 
This is obvious because the sum of the probabilities of all final outcomes for an experiment is 1, and all the final outcomes are equally likely. 
In contrast, the probability of a compound event A is equal to the number of outcomes
favorable to event A divided by the total number of outcomes for the experiment.
Flashcard: Two or more outcomes (or events) that have the same probability of
occurrence are said to be equally likely outcomes (or events). = Equally Likely Outcomes

According to the classical probability rule, the probability of a simple event is equal to 1
divided by the total number of outcomes for the experiment. 
This is obvious because the sum of the probabilities of all final outcomes for an experiment is 1, and all the final outcomes are |equally likely. 
In contrast, the probability of a compound event A is equal to the number of outcomes favorable to event A divided by the total number of outcomes for the experiment.


 


1If the final answer for the probability of an event does not terminate within three decimal places, usually it is rounded
to four decimal places.

Solution
This experiment has a total of six outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. 
All these outcomes are equally likely. 
Let A be an event that an even number is observed on the die. 
Event A includes three outcomes: 2, 4, and 6; that is,

 
Calculating the probability of a compound event.
In a group of 500 women, 120 have played golf at least once. 
Suppose one of these 500 women is randomly selected.

What is the probability that she has played golf at least once?

Solution 
Because the selection is to be made randomly, 
each of the 500 women has the same probability of being selected. 

Consequently, this experiment has a total of 500 equally likely outcomes. 
One hundred and twenty of these 500 outcomes are included in the event that the selected woman has played golf at least once. Hence,

P (selected woman has played golf at least once) = 120/500 = .24



Relative Frequency Concept of Probability
Suppose we want to calculate the following probabilities:
1.	The probability that the next car that comes out of an auto factory is a “lemon”

2.	The probability that a randomly selected family owns a home

3.	The probability that a randomly selected woman has never smoked

4.	The probability that an 80-year-old person will live for at least 1 more year

5.	The probability that the tossing of an unbalanced coin will result in a head

6.	The probability that a randomly selected person owns a sport-utility vehicle (SUV)


These probabilities cannot be computed using the classical probability rule 
because the various outcomes for the corresponding experiments are not equally likely. 
Eg. The odd of a recession might be 20%, 
the event of a depression might be 50%, 
the event of the economy maintaining its state might be 30%. 
They are not equal likely outcomes that the 50% of the toss of a coin.

For example, the next car manufactured at an auto factory may or may not be a lemon. 
The two outcomes, 
“it is a lemon” and 
“it is not a lemon,” are not equally likely.

If they were, then (approximately) half the cars manufactured by this company would be lemons, and this might prove disastrous to the survival of the firm.

Although the various outcomes for each of these experiments are not equally likely, each of
these experiments can be performed again and again to generate data. 

In such cases, to calculate probabilities, 
we either use past data or generate new data by performing the experiment a large number of times. 

The relative frequency of an event is used as an approximation for the probability
of that event. 
This method of assigning a probability to an event is called the 
relative frequency concept of probability. 

Because relative frequencies are determined by performing an experiment,
the probabilities calculated using relative frequencies may change almost each time an experiment
is repeated. 

For example, every time a new sample of 500 cars is selected from the production line
of an auto factory, the number of lemons in those 500 cars is expected to be different. 

However,
the variation in the percentage of lemons will be small if the sample size is large. Note that if we
are considering the population, the relative frequency will give an exact probability.



Using Relative Frequency as an Approximation of Probability 
If an experiment is repeated n times and an event A is observed f times, 
then, according to the relative frequency concept of probability,

P(A) = f/n

Eg P(25% selloff in the stock market) = ??



Approximating probability by relative frequency: sample data.
Ten of the 500 randomly selected cars manufactured at a certain auto factory 
are found to be lemons.
Assuming that the lemons are manufactured randomly, what is the probability that the
next car manufactured at this auto factory is a lemon?
Solution Let n denote the total number of cars in the sample and f the number of lemons
in n. Then,
n = 500 
and 
f = 10
Using the relative concept of probability, we obtain
P = (next car is a lemon) = f/n = 10/ 500 = .02
This probability is actually the relative frequency of lemons in 500 cars.

 Table 4.2 lists the
frequency and relative frequency distributions for this example
 
The column of relative frequencies in Table 4.2 is used as the column of approximate probabilities.
Thus, from the relative frequency column
P (next car is a good car) = .98
P (next car is a lemon) = .02

Note that relative frequencies are not exact probabilities but are approximate probabilities
unless they are based on a census. 
However, if the experiment is repeated again and again, this approximate probability of an outcome obtained from the relative frequency will approach the actual probability of that outcome. 
This is called the Law of Large Numbers.

Flashcard:
Law of Large Numbers 
If an experiment is repeated again and again, the probability of an event
obtained from the relative frequency approaches the actual or theoretical probability.

Approximating probability by relative frequency.
Allison wants to determine the probability that a randomly selected family from New York
State owns a home. How can she determine this probability?
Solution 
There are two outcomes for a randomly selected family from New York State: 
“This
family owns a home”
 and “this family does not own a home.” 

These two events are not equally likely. 

(Note that these two outcomes will be equally likely if exactly half of the families in
New York State own homes and exactly half do not own homes.) 

Hence, the classical probability rule cannot be applied. 

However, we can repeat this experiment again and again.

 In other words, we can select a sample of families from New York State and observe whether or not
each of them owns a home. 
Hence, we will use the relative frequency approach to probability

Suppose Allison selects 
a random sample of 1000 families from New York State
 and observes that 730 of them own homes and  270 do not own homes. 
Then,
 
Again, note that .730 is just an approximation of the probability that a randomly selected
family from New York State owns a home. 

Every time Allison repeats this experiment she may obtain a different probability for this event. 
However, because the sample size (n _ 1000) in this example is large, the variation is expected to be very small.



‘
 
Subjective Probability
Many times we face experiments that  neither have equally likely outcomes  nor can be repeated to generate data. In such cases, we cannot compute the probabilities of events using the classical probability rule or the relative frequency concept.

For example, consider the following probabilities of events:

1. The probability that Carol, who is taking a statistics course, will earn an A in the course
2. The probability that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will be higher at the end of the next
trading day
3. The probability that the New York Giants will win the Super Bowl next season
4. The probability that Joe will lose the lawsuit he has filed against his landlord


Neither the classical probability rule nor the relative frequency concept of probability can
be applied to calculate probabilities for these examples. 

All these examples belong to experiments
that have neither equally likely outcomes nor the potential of being repeated. 

For example, Carol, who is taking statistics, will take the test (or tests) only once, and based on that she
will either earn an A or not. 

The two events “she will earn an A” and “she will not earn an A”
are not equally likely. 

The probability assigned to an event in such cases is called subjective
probability. 

It is based on the individual’s judgment, experience, information, and belief. 

Carol may assign a high probability to the event that she will earn an A in statistics, 
whereas her instructor may assign a low probability to the same event.


Subjective probability is assigned arbitrarily. It is usually influenced by the biases, preferences,
and experience of the person assigning the probability.

SECTION
Counting Rule

The experiments dealt with so far in this chapter have had only a few outcomes, which were easy
to list. 

However, for experiments with a large number of outcomes, it may not be easy to list all
outcomes. (this is the case of an economy – there are just so many outcomes, this is why economies across the world are different)

In such cases, we may use the counting rule to find the total number of outcomes.

 


Suppose we toss a coin three times. 
This experiment has three steps: the first toss, the second
toss, and the third toss. 
Each step has two outcomes: a head and a tail. 
Thus,

Total outcomes for three tosses of a coin = 2 x 2 x 2 = 8

The eight outcomes for this experiment are HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, and TTT.


Applying the counting
rule: 2 steps

A prospective car buyer can 
choose between a fixed and a variable interest rate 
and can also
choose a payment period of 36 months, 48 months, or 60 months. 
How many total outcomes are possible?

Solution 
This experiment is made up of two steps: 
•	choosing an interest rate and 
•	selecting a loan payment period. 
There are two outcomes (a fixed or a variable interest rate) for the first
step and 
three outcomes (a payment period of 36 months, 48 months, or 60 months) for the
second step. 

Hence,
Total outcomes = 2 x 3 = 6





Applying the counting
rule: 16 steps
A National Football League team will play 16 games during a regular season. 

Each game can
result in one of three outcomes: a win, a loss, or a tie. 

The total possible outcomes for 16
games are calculated as follows:

 

One of the 43,046,721 possible outcomes is all 16 wins.









Marginal and Conditional Probabilities

Suppose all 100 employees of a company were asked whether they are in favor of or against
paying high salaries to CEOs of U.S. companies. 

Table 4.3 gives a two-way classification of
the responses of these 100 employees.

 


Table 4.3 shows the distribution of 100 employees based on two variables or characteristics:
gender (male or female) 
and opinion (in favor or against). 

Such a table is called a contingency table. 
In Table 4.3, each box that contains a number is called a cell. 
Notice that there are four cells. Each cell gives the frequency for two characteristics.

For example, 15 employees in
this group possess two characteristics: “male” and “in favor of paying high salaries to CEOs.”

We can interpret the numbers in other cells the same way.

 

Suppose one employee is selected at random from these 100 employees. 

This employee may be classified either on the basis of gender alone or on the basis of opinion. 
If only one characteristic is considered at a time, the employee selected 
can be a male, a female, in favor, or against. 
The probability of each of these four characteristics or events is called marginal probability or simple probability. 

These probabilities are called marginal probabilities because
they are calculated by dividing the corresponding row margins (totals for the rows) or column
margins (totals for the columns) by the grand total.

 



 


Now suppose that one employee is selected at random from these 100 employees. 
Furthermore,
assume it is known that this (selected) employee is a male.

In other words, the event that
the employee selected is a male has already occurred. 

What is the probability that the employee
selected is in favor of paying high salaries to CEOs?
This probability is written as follows:
P (in favor | male ) – in favour is the event whose probability is to be determined and male is the event that has already occurred.



This probability, P(in favor | male) , is called the conditional probability of  “in favor” given that the event “male” has already happened. It is read as “ the probability that the employee selected is in favor given that this employee is a male.”

 


In finance, financial instituations assess the probability of default on loans given certain conditions (e.g. economic downturns, borrower xtics)

Insurance: companies calculate the likelihood of claims based on variables like age, health, and lifestyle

In investment decisions, portfolio management to be precise, investors use conditional probabilities to evaluate the performance of assets under different market conditions, aiding in diversification and risk management.


Market Trends: Analysts assess the likelihood of stock price movements based on past performance and currenct events e.g earning reports

Macroeconomic models: economists use conditional probabilities to predict economic indicators (like GDP growth) based on certain conditions (e.g interest rates, inflation)

Policy impact analysis:
Govt analyze the potential effects of policy changes (eg. Tax adjustements ) on economic outcomes

Behavioral Econs: Consumer behavior: marketers utilize conditional probabilities to predict purchasing behavior based on factors such as income level and demographics


Game theory: In strategic decision0making, players assess the prob of other’s actions based on their own choices

Finaanical derivaties: The Black-Scholes model incorporates conditional probabilities to determine the pricing of options based on the likelihood of differetn price movements.]


Specific examples

Risk Assessment
A bank might determine that 
the prob of a borrower defaulting on a loan is 5% under normal economic condition. 
However, if the unemployment rate rises above 10%, the conditional prob of default might increase to 15%.

Credit Risk Example:
P (Default | High unemployment) – defaulting is the event whose prob is to be determined 
and high unemployment is the event that has already occurred.

# Credit Risk Example
unemployment_rate = 10

if unemployment_rate > 10:
    default_probability = 0.15 # Probability of default given high unemployment
else: 
    default_probability = 0.05 # Normal conditions


An insurance company estimates that the prob of a customer filing a claim is 2%. 
However, if the customer is over 65 years old, the conditional prob of filing a claim increases to 10%.

P (claim | senior) –filing claim is the event whose prob is to be determined 
and being a senior is the event that has already occurred or condition that is certain.


# Insurance Example
age = 66

if age > 65:
    claim_probability = 0.10 # P(filing a claim for seniors)
else:
    claim_probability = 0.02 # Normal conditions



Investor Decisions
An investor’s historical data shows that a tech stock has a 70% chance of increasing in value if the market index rises. They can use this conditional prob to decide whether to increase their investments in tech stocks based on market trends.

P (stock price increase | market index rises)

|If a company’s earnings report is positive, 
Then analysts might asses that there’s a 60% prob that the stock will rise in the following month. 
If the report is negative, 
then that probability drops to 20%.

P (stock price rise | negative report) read as What’s the probability of a stock price increases when there is a negative earning’s report?
Economic Forecasting
Economists might find that if inflation is above 3%, 
then there is a 40% chance that GDP will contract in the next quarter.
|If inflation is below 3%,
then the chance drops to 10%

A government considering a tax cut might analyze that 
if consumer confidence is high,
then there’s a 70% chance that economic growth exceed 3%. 
If consumer confidence is low, 
the chance drops to 30%.


Behavioral Economics
A retail company finds that if a consumer receives a discount offer, there is a 50% chance they will purchases the item. Without the discount, the prob drops to 20%.

In a competitive market, a company may estimate that if their competiror lowers prices, there is an 80% chance they will lose market share. If the competitor mains prices, the chances of losing market share is only 30%.


Financial Derivatives
Options pricing: in the black scholes model, the price of the call option may depend on the conditional probability of the underlying asset exceeing a certain price at expiration. 
If the stock price is currently $50, but analysts believe there is a 75% probability it will exceed $60 in one month, this influcens the pricing of the option.


Calculating the conditional probability: two-way table

Compute the conditional probability P (in favor | male) for the data on 100 employees given
in Table 4.4.
 

The probability P(in favor | male) is the conditional probability that a randomly
selected employee is in favor given that this employee is a male. It is known that the event
“male” has already occurred. Based on the information that the employee selected is a male,
we can infer that the employee selected must be one of the 60 males and, hence, must belong
to the first row of Table 4.4. Therefore, we are concerned only with the first row of that table.

The required conditional probability is calculated as follows:

P (in favor | male) = No of males in favor/ Total no of males = 15/60 = 0.25

 

Script: As we can observe from this computation of conditional probability, 
the total number of males (the event that has already occurred) is written in the denominator 
and the number of males who are in favor (the event whose probability we are to find) 
is written in the numerator.

Note that we are considering the row of the event that has already occurred. 
The tree diagram in Figure 4.6 illustrates this example.



Calculating the conditional probability: two-way table.
For the data of Table 4.4, calculate the conditional probability that a randomly selected employee
is a female given that this employee is in favor of paying high salaries to CEOs.

Script:
Solution We are to compute the probability P(female | in favor). 
Because it is known that the employee selected is in favor of paying high salaries to CEOs, this employee must belong to the first column (the column labeled “in favor”) 
and must be one of the 19 employees who
are in favor.
 
 


 




NEXT MODULE: MUTUALLY EXCLUS|IV|E EVEENTA
What are mutally Exclusive Events?

Script: Events that cannot occur together are called mutually exclusive events. 
Such events do not have any common outcomes.
 If two or more events are mutually exclusive, then at most one of
them will occur every time we repeat the experiment. 
Thus the occurrence of one event excludes
the occurrence of the other event or events.

For any experiment, the final outcomes are always mutually exclusive because one and only
one of these outcomes is expected to occur in one repetition of the experiment. For example,
consider tossing a coin twice. This experiment has four outcomes: HH, HT, TH, and TT. These
outcomes are mutually exclusive because one and only one of them will occur when we toss
this coin twice

Illustrating mutually
exclusive and mutually
nonexclusive events.

Consider the following events for one roll of a die:
A = an even number is observed = {2, 4, 6 }
B = an odd number is observed = { 1, 3, 5}
C = a number less than 5 is observed = { 1, 2, 3. 4}

ENGAGE: 
Are events A and B mutually exclusive? 
Are events A and C mutually exclusive?

THOUGHTA: A and B are mutually exclusive because you cannot haave both odd and even number occurring at once on a single roll of a dice but A and C are not mutually exclusive because the numbers 2 and 4 are both even numbers and also less than 5. These two events occurred in a single throw of a die.

 

Script: 
As we can observe from the definitions of events A and B and from Figure 4.8, events A
and B have no common element. For one roll of a die, only one of the two events A and B
can happen. Hence, these are two mutually exclusive events. 

We can observe from the definitions
of events A and C and from Figure 4.9 that events A and C have two common outcomes:
2-spot and 4-spot. 
Thus, if we roll a die and obtain either a 2-spot or a 4-spot, then A and C
happen at the same time. Hence, events A and C are not mutually exclusive.


Illustrating mutually exclusive events.

Consider the following two events for a randomly selected adult: 
N = this adult has never shopped on the Internet
Y = this adult has shopped on the internet at least once
Are events Y and N mutually exclusive?

Solution 
Note that event Y consists of all adults who have shopped on the Internet at least
once, and event N includes all adults who have never shopped on the Internet. These two events
are illustrated in the Venn diagram in Figure 4.10.
 


As we can observe from the definitions of events Y and N and from Figure 4.10, events Y
and N have no common outcome. 

They represent two distinct sets/clusters of adults: the ones who have
shopped on the Internet at least once and the ones who have never shopped on the Internet.

Hence, these two events are mutually exclusive.


NEXT SECTION
Independent Versus Dependent Events
In the case of two independent events, the occurrence of one event does not change the probability
of the occurrence of the other event.

 
It can be shown that if one of these two conditions is true, then the second will also be true,
and if one is not true, then the second will also not be true.

If the occurrence of one event affects the probability of the occurrence of the other event,
then the two events are said to be dependent events. 
In probability notation, the two events are dependent if either P (A | B) does not equal P(A) or P (B | A ) does not equal P(B)

Illustrating two dependent events: two-way table.


Refer to the information on 100 employees given in Table 4.4 in Section 4.4. Are events
“female (F)” and “in favor (A)” independent?
Solution
Events F and A will be independent if 
P (F) = P (F | A)
Otherwise they will be dependent.
Using the information given in Table 4.4, we compute the following two probabilities
P (F) = 40/100 = .40
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
00000000000000000000
00000000000000000000
00000000000000000000
00000000000000000000

And 
P (F | A) = .2105

Because these two probabilities are not equal, the two events are dependent. 

Here, dependence of events means that the respective percentages of males who are in favor of and against
paying high salaries to CEOs are different from the respective percentages of females who are
in favor and against.

In this example, the dependence of A and F can also be proved by showing that 
the probabilities P(A) and P(A| F) are not equal.


Ilustrating two independent events.
A box contains a total of 100 CDs that were manufactured on two machines.
Of them, 60 were manufactured on Machine I.

Of the total CDs, 15 are defective. Of the 60 CDs that were manufactured
on Machine I, 9 are defective.

Let D be the event that a randomly selected CD is defective, 
and let A be the event that a randomly selected CD was manufactured on Machine I. 

Are events D and A independent?

Solution
From the given information

P(D) = 15/100 =0.15
And P(D|A) = 9 /60 = 0.15

Hence 
P(D) = P (D | A)

Consequently, the two events, D and A, are independent.

Independence, in this example, means that the probability of any CD being defective is the
same, .15, irrespective of the machine on which it is manufactured. 


In other words, the two
machines are producing the same percentage of defective CDs.

 For example, 9 of the 60 CDs manufactured on Machine I are defective, 
and 6 of the 40 CDs manufactured on Machine II are defective. 

Thus, for each of the two machines, 15% of the CDs produced are defective.


 

Using this table, we can find the following probabilities:

P(D) = 15/100 =0.15

And P(D|A) = 9 /60 = 0.15

Because these two probabilities are the same, the two events are independent

Two Important Observations _
We can make the following two important observations about mutually exclusive, independent,
and dependent events. 
1. Two events are either mutually exclusive or independent.2
a. Mutually exclusive events are always dependent.
b. Independent events are never mutually exclusive.
2. Dependent events may or may not be mutually exclusive.
2The exception to this rule occurs when at least one of the two events has a zero probability.







Break this down…
Complementary Events
Two mutually exclusive events 
that taken together include all the outcomes for an experiment
are called complementary events. 
Note that two complementary events are always mutually exclusive.

 

 

Because two complementary events, taken together, include all the outcomes for an experiment
and because the sum of the probabilities of all outcomes is 1,

 
 

Calculating probabilities of complementary events.
In a group of 2000 taxpayers, 
400 have been audited by the IRS at least once. 

If one taxpayer is randomly selected from this group, 
what are the two complementary events for this experiment, 
and what are their probabilities?

Solution 
The two complementary events for this experiment are

Event A = the selected taxpayer has been audited by the IRS at least once
Event B = the selected taxpayer has NEVER been audited by the IRS

Note that here 
Event A includes the 400 taxpayers who have been audited by the IRS at least
once, and 
Event B includes the 1600 taxpayers who have never been audited by the IRS. 
Hence, the probabilities of events A and B are 
P(A) = 400/2000 = 0.2 and 
P(B) = 1600/2000 = 0.80

As we can observe, the sum of these two probabilities is one.

 


Calculating probabilities of complementary events.

In a group of 5000 adults, 
3500 are in favor of stricter gun control laws, 
1200 are against such
laws, and 300 have no opinion. 

One adult is randomly selected from this group. 
Let A be the event that this adult is in favor of stricter gun control laws. 

What is the complementary event of A? 
What are the probabilities of the two events?

Solution 

The two complementary events for this experiment are
Event A = the selected adult is in favor of stricter gun control laws
Event B = the selected adult is either against such laws or has no opinion

Note that here event A includes 1500 adults who are either against stricter gun control laws
or have no opinion. 

Also notice that events A and B are complements of each other. 

Because 3500 adults in the group favor stricter gun control laws and 1500 either are against stricter
gun control laws or have no opinion, the probabilities of events A and are

P(A) = 3500/5000 = 0.70 and
P(B) = 1500/5000 = 0.30

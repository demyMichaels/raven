 Heat Transfer 
 
 (i) conduction, convection and radiation as modes of heat transfer; 
 (ii)  temperature gradient, thermal conductivity and heat flux;
 (iii) effect of the nature of the surface on the energy radiated and absorbed by it;
 (iv) the conductivities of common materials;
 (v) the thermos flask and vacuum flask; 
 (vi) land and sea breeze; 
 (vii) combustion engine.

 i. differentiate between conduction, convection and radiation as modes of heat transfer; 
 ii.  solve problems on temperature gradient, thermal conductivity and heat flux; 
 iii. assess the effect of the nature of the surface on the energy radiated and absorbed by it; 
 iv. compare the conductivities of common materials; 
 v. relate the component part of the working of the thermos flask; 
 vi. differentiate between land and sea breeze; 
 vii. analyse the principles of operating internal combustion jet engines, rockets.

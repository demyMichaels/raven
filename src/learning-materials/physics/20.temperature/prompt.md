The zeroth law of thermodynamics
this basically means motion of heat
that is transfer of heat between different bodies
e.g if we put ice into water
the heat energy from water (at higher temperature) is transferred to the ice and eventually 
breaks the intermolecular molecules of the ice



The celsius and fahrenheit scales
- Convert a temperature between any two (linear) temperature scales, including the celsis, fahrenheit and kelvin scales

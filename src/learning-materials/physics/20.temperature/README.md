Temperature and Its Measurement 
(i) concept of temperature 
(ii) thermometric properties 
(iii) calibration of thermometers 
(iv) temperature scales–Celsius and Kelvin. 
(v) types of thermometers 
(vi) conversion from one scale of temperature to another


Candidates should be able to: 
i. identify thermometric properties of materials that are used for different thermometers; 
ii. calibrate thermometers;
iii.  differentiate between temperature scales 
e.g. Celsius, Faranheight and Kelvin; 
iv. compare the types of thermometers; 
vi. convert from one scale of temperature to another.

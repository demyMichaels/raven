17. Vapours 

(i) unsaturated and saturated vapours;
(ii) relationship between saturated vapour pressure (S.V.P) and boiling; 
(iii) determination of S.V.P by barometer tube method; 
(iv) formation of dew, mist, fog, clouds and rain; 
(v)  study of dew point, humidity and relative humidity; 
(vi) hygrometry; estimation of the humidity of the atmosphere using wet and dry bulb hygrometers.

 i.  distinguish between saturated and unsaturated vapours; 
 ii.  relate saturated vapour pressure to boiling point; 
 iii. determine S.V.P by barometer tube method; 
 iv. differentiate between dew point, humidity and relative humidity; 
 vi. estimate the humidity of the atmosphere using wet and dry bulb hygrometers; 
 vii. solve numerical problems.

### 7.2 CITIZEN
**Definition:** 
A citizen is defined as a legal member of a state with full constitutional or legal rights in the country in which he or she resides. He enjoys certain rights and privileges and owes certain responsibilities and obligations to the state.

### 7.3 WAYS OF ACQUIRING CITIZENSHIP
1. **By birth:** A person is a citizen by birth if either of his parents, mother or father is a citizen of a country.
2. **By naturalisation:** Somebody can become a citizen of a country where he lives through naturalisation. This is possible if he can satisfy the constitutional requirements for naturalisation.
3. **Marriage or registration:** 
If a woman is married to a person of another nationality, she can acquire the citizenship of the husband's country through registration, for example, a Nigerian woman married to a British, or a British woman married to a Nigerian.
4. **Dual citizenship:** 
It is legitimately possible for a person to hold citizenship of two countries. For example, a child born to Nigerian parents living in American becomes a U.S. citizen. The baby is also a Nigerian because the parents are Nigerians.
5. **Honorary citizenship:** 
An individual could be honoured with the citizenship of another country. This is made possible if the individual has distinguished himself herself in a particular area.
6. **Citizenship by descent:** 
This is when grandparents claimed to have migrated from somewhere.
7. **Citizenship by adoption:** 
If a family living in a country decides to adopt from another country through legal process, it is a one way of acquiring citizenship.
8. **Through conquest or wars:** 
Another way of acquiring citizenship is through conquest or wars and by bringing under control those people conquered.


### Qualifications for Citizenship
These are qualifications or conditions an individual has to satisfy before he could become a citizen of another country.

1. **Through disloyalty:** 
A naturalised citizen can lose his citizenship if his activities are prejudicial to the country's corporate existence.
2. **Supporting another country:** 
If a citizen is found supporting another country engaged in war with his country, his citizenship may be deprived him.

The individual can also lose his citizenship if, within a period of say 5 to 7 years after becoming naturalised, he gets involved in a criminal case resulting in his incarceration for some years.
4. **False declaration:** 
If there is a fundamental breach of the citizenship agreement binding him, e.g. false declaration.

### 7.5 RIGHTS OF A CITIZEN
**Meaning:** 
Fundamental human rights means that every individual at birth is endowed with certain rights: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Most of these rights are recognised and entrenched in the constitution of most countries. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the state to ensure that its citizens enjoy these rights.

### Human Rights Situation in Nigeria
Human rights are best practised and promoted in a democratic setting than in a military regime. The democratic structure on ground allows for an independent and impartial judiciary to guard and promote the rights of citizens.

A written constitution defining these rights, the application of the rule of law and of express to write and express issues constructively and objectively are put in place to ensure that human rights are kept.

Throughout the military era in Nigeria, promotion and safeguarding of the rights of man have no place or content as the system was dictatorial in all aspects.

Similarly, suspension of the constitution and the issuing of decrees and edicts are pointers to the fact that Nigeria during the military governments did not have their rights promoted but abused.

### Impact of Human Rights on National Development
1. It has been argued in some quarters that equal rights of men and women help greatly in promoting social progress and better standards of life and greater freedom.
2. The activities of human rights have impacted on the civil and political rights of the people, thereby guaranteeing freedom from fear.
3. The government's respect for economic, social and cultural rights is to ensure freedom of the populace.
4. Many countries have enshrined the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in their constitutions.
5. The Day of its adoption, 10th December 1948 is internationally observed every year as Human Rights Day.

### Human Rights Groups
A remarkable increase of worldwide activity has been recorded by the rapid growth of the Human Rights movements. Today, there are over thousand independent domestic Human Rights groups and other organisations campaigning for human rights.

For example, in Nigeria, individual journalists, members of Civil Liberty Organisation (CLO), politicians, Transparency International, abscationists and trade unionists have all played their part in bringing human rights to the headlines. In fact, this has increased the pressure on officialdom and shifted the balance in favour of the protection of human rights.

Another international group of great repute is Amnesty International. It is a worldwide movement of people trying in a very practical way to ensure wider respect for some of the fundamental rights proclaimed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This group is independent and impartial, not supporting or opposing any government or political system.

This movement was launched over 25 years ago with more than 700,000 members and subscribers in over 150 countries and territories.

The movement is open to anyone who supports the goals of the movement and works together with the movement to raise all the funds needed. It does not seek or receive government money.

### Activities/Functions of Human Rights Groups
1. The groups seek the release of prisoners of conscience. Prisoners of conscience are the people detained anywhere for their beliefs, colour, sex, ethnic origin, language or religion, who have not used or advocated violence.
2. They seek for fair and prompt trials for all political prisoners.
3. They oppose torture, victimisation and executions in all cases.
4. The body collects reports of human rights violations from all over the world. If the information is correct after verification and falls within the charter for action, contact is made with the government concerned, asking officials to make sure that the victims rights are protected.

### The Declaration of Human Rights
In 1948, governments set a new world standard for human rights – the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

These Human Rights were universally declared and adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10th December, 1948.

This declaration has had an immense impact throughout the whole world. Many countries have enshrined its principles in their constitutions.

The Day of its adoption is internationally observed every year as Human Rights Day.



### 7.10 CIVIL SOCIETY
**Definition:** Civil Society is a non-governmental organisation formed with the intention of promoting and protecting the interests of the people as well as mobilising them for effective participation in the governance and development of the country.

### Impediments to the Effectiveness of Civil Societies in Nigeria
1. **Political manipulations:** Civil societies are vulnerable, resulting in easy manipulation by politicians.
2. **Corruption:** Members are often accused of corrupt practices, generating lack of trust and confidence even within the organisation.
3. **Divided loyalty:** Owing to political manipulation, loyalty and interests on the part of the members, the members are divided. This has the capacity of affecting negatively the realisation of the aims and objectives of the society.
4. **Insufficient funding:** The running of the society is always faced with insufficient fund.
5. **Personality clash:** Some of the self-centred leaders are guilty of trying to pervert the realisation of the goals set, owing to personality clashes or infighting within the leadership.
6. **Political instability:** This can affect the activities of the society especially if the government in power is dictatorial in outlook.
7. **Absence of enlightenment:** The people do not have adequate information about the existence and even the activities of the civil society.
8. **Partisan politics:** The involvement of the leadership in politics is a setback to the effectiveness of the society.
9. **Lack of accountability:** This can affect support and encouragement from external bodies.
10. **Insincerity/rivalry:** This may rear its ugly heads among civil societies, resulting in their inability to achieve their set goals and inability to work towards a common goal.
11. **External sources:** Over-dependence on funds from external sources is capable of affecting some of their operations, especially when the support is not regular.
12. **Dearth of information:** They, at times, find it difficult to access relevant information for their activities or operations.
13. **No attention from government:** This is because some of the civil societies have antagonistic posture and so do not get needed attention from government.
14. **Rigidity:** Members are often rigid on their views about public interest.
15. **Preferential treatment:** This is mostly observed whenever they are set for any operation.
16. **Restriction:** Some of the civil societies are not open, and so admission into the society is restricted.

### Additional Ways to Safeguard Rights
2. **Reduction of poverty level:** There should be a drastic reduction of poverty level in the society.
10. **Rule of law:** Those in government should govern the people according to the provisions of the constitution. Also, the citizens have to obey the laws of the land as well as respect the constitution.
11. **Opposition:** There should be in existence, vibrant opposition in the political system, e.g. civil rights group.
12. **Pressure groups:** The system should also accommodate pressure groups – NBA, NMA, NUT, NIJ, etc.
13. **International conventions:** Respect for international conventions on Human Rights by the government.
14. **Checks and balances:** Upholding the doctrine of separation of powers with appropriate checks and balances.
15. **Public opinion:** This must be effectively used to protect any violation of the rights of the citizens.
16. **Free legal aid:** Free legal aid for the less privileged to be in place and not to be ignored.

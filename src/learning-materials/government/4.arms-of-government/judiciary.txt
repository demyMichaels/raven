THE JUDICIARY Meaning:** The judiciary constitutes the arm of government that interprets the law of the state and applies the existing law to individual cases. In any modern state, the liberty of individuals depends upon the fairness of the courts in providing protection against the tyranny of overzealous members of the government.

In Nigeria, for example, the judiciary is made up of a large number of courts, ranging from the Supreme court, Appeal courts, High courts and down to magistrate and customary courts. The judiciary consists of judges who are honest and impartial with sound legal knowledge.

### 5.8 THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY

**Meaning:** An independent judiciary is one which is free from the interference of the other two arms of government – the executive and legislature. Judges should be free when interpreting the law of the land; they should work without fear or favour. Unless the judiciary is independent, it will not be able to pass judgements impartially. Besides, it will not be able to defend citizens against wrongful use of power by an unpopular Head of state. Therefore, the independence of the judiciary is a necessity, if people are to enjoy their rights and freedom.

**Reasons for the Independence of the Judiciary**
1. **Appointment:** Judges and magistrates should not be appointed by the executive

***

orthe legislature; they should be appointed by a neutral body such as the Judicial Service Commission.

2. Independence of the judiciary: Judges must be independent from the absolute control of either the executive or the legislature. The judiciary should be free from arbitrary control.

3. Promotion of judges: Promotion of judges should also be done by an independently.

4. Remuneration: The salaries and allowances of judges should not be subject to frequent alterations and must be sufficient. To promote this, they are paid from the consolidated account.

5. Security of tenure: No other arm of government should have the power to remove a judge. He has to remain in office as long as he is of good behaviour and free from corruption.

6. Immunity: Judges must be immuned from the law so as to discharge their duties without fear or favour.

7. Judges must not belong to any political party: They must not belong to any political party so that they would not be influenced by the political tide.

8. Extra security: Security should be provided for judges in and outside the courts so that they will not be intimidated.

9. Impartially: Their independence will enable judges to discharge their duties impartially.

10. Protection of liberty: This will help to protect the liberty of the citizens.

11. Confidence: This independence will help to consolidate the confidence people have in (the) judiciary.

12. Independent arbiter: It will serve as independent arbiter for the interpretation of the constitution and other laws.

13. Rule of law: Independence of judiciary will promote strict observance of the rule of law.

**5.9 PROBLEMS/ENCROACHMENTS ON THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY**

1. Political appointments: In some countries, the appointment of judges is influenced by the executives. The executives have often used their power to appoint persons known to support their policies.

2. Decrees: Military regimes promulgate decrees that cannot be challenged in the law courts.

3. Disrespect of court decisions/orders: Sometimes, the decisions of the law courts are disobeyed by the executive.

4. Governments based on dictatorship: Dictatorial governments have the ability of interfering in the activities of the judiciary. Such governments come up at times with obnoxious laws.

5. Inadequate facilities in the courts: For example, stationery, light, water and verbatim reporting machine are lacking in courts today.

6. Political interference: Often times, the decisions of the courts may unduly be influenced by the other arms of government.

7. Backdating of laws: In Britain, for example, no court can question the Acts of parliament because of its supremacy. The Parliament can even backdate laws to favour a particular individual, e.g. a politician, and thereby render decisions of courts useless.

8. Insufficient personnel: There are few judges to deal with large volumes of cases, leading to delays in treatment of cases.

9. Bribery and corruption: Bribery and corruption lead to lack of confidence in the judiciary.

10. Poor conditions of service: Poor conditions of service of the judicial officers are some of the problems facing the judiciary.
11. Setting up of tribunals: Sometimes, people making up the tribunals do not have proper legal training. Hence, they cannot interpret the laws adequately.
12. Interest: The personal interest of the judge in a particular case may limit the independence of the judiciary.
13. Poor funding: The Judiciary is constantly faced with inadequate financial resources or poor funding.
14. Party influence: Judgements of the courts at times could be influenced by political parties, especially the party in government.
15. Social ties: Factors such as family, ethnic religion, etc. can influence the decisions of the courts’ encroachments on the independence of the judiciary.
16. National interest: A case that can affect the integrity of the state could be jettisoned in order to protect national or public interest.
17. Poor remuneration: Another limitation is the poor remuneration of judges and judicial staff.

**5.10 WAYS BY WHICH THE EFFICIENCY OF THE JUDICIARY CAN BE GUARANTEED IN SAFEGUARDING THE RIGHTS OF A CITIZEN**
1. Appointment: A neutral body and not the Executive should appoint the officials of judiciary.
2. Dismissal: As long as the executive does not appoint judges, they should also not be involved in their dismissal.
3. Separation of powers: In keeping with the theory of separation of powers among the organs of government, there is the need to respect this by strictly adhering to this theory.
4. Remuneration: The salaries and remunerations of judges should be sufficient and this should be from the consolidated fund.
5. Funding: The executive should keep its hand off funding the judiciary.
6. Immunity: Immunity of the judiciary as one of the arms of government will ensure efficiency.
7. Promotion: Judges should be promoted when due and should not be from the executive arm of government.

11. Security: There should be enough security provided for judges both within and outside the courts, so that threats to their lives, harassment, etc. are checked.
12. Fair treatment: Judges should be treated fairly and this in return will promote efficiency of the judiciary. It will also help them to remain impartial in the execution of their duties.

**5.11 PLEA BARGAIN**
Black’s Law Dictionary defines Plea Bargain as the “process whereby the accused and the prosecutor in a criminal case work out a mutually

***

**[IMG_5043.png]**

satisfactory disposition of the case subject to court approval”.

Plea bargaining results in a plea agreement between the prosecutor, the lawyer who leads the case against a defendant (the accused). In this agreement, the defendant agrees to plead guilty without a trial and, in return, the prosecutor agrees to dismiss certain charges or make favourable sentence recommendations to the court.

The key operating words are “agreement” and “approval” of the court. Agreement must be between the prosecuting counsel (lawyer for the government or state) and the defense counsel (lawyer standing for the accused). And whatever agreement is reached must receive the approval of the court.

However, plea bargaining is never automatic and may not be implemented arbitrarily. Here in Nigeria, the Attorney General of the Federation should be the head of prosecution. He is supposed to give his approval to any plea bargaining agreement before such an agreement could be presented to the Presiding Judge.

In plea bargaining, a criminal case could be concluded without a trial and this is a minus for an institution seen as the last hope of the people against the wrongful use of power by an unpopular government.

4. **Limitation to the application of the rule of law:** This process is a limitation to the application of the rule of law. The law is supposed to be supreme over everybody irrespective of one’s political or economic status. What applies to the rich should also apply to the poor. The law is not a respecter of any person.

5. **Zeal for hard work will be jettisoned:** This is because a short cut to money making has been discovered.

**5.12 JUSTICE**
**Meaning:** Justice is a state of being fair, equitable, impartial or unbiased, neutral in treating or handling issues or matters involving groups or individuals in society. There should be fair treatment of people, and laws based on the principle of equal rights and justice followed and given its rightful place.

### Arguments against Plea Bargaining

1. **Outright abuse:** Today, plea bargaining is used more frequently than before and it has started to be abused. For example, a situation in which an accused person is charged with embezzling public fund to the tune of \( \varnothing 20 \) million, he agrees to return the sum of \( \varnothing 10 \) million in a plea bargain. This is indeed wrong and should be corrected or rejected outright.

2. **Embezzlement of public fund:** Many people or officials in government, even as custodians of public funds, may begin to embezzle public funds with impunity.

3. **Punishment of offenders:** Punishment of offenders in the state is the sole function of the judiciary and so, due process of law should take the centre stage in judging cases with criminal tendencies.


(1) The blindfold: The blindfold represents objectivity in giving out justice without fear or favour regardless of wealth, popularity, political power and affiliation, status, etc.

(2) The sword: The sword symbolises the readiness to dispense and enforce justice. The double-edged nature of the sword signifies that justice can go either way as long as substantiated and established.

(3) The scale: The scale stands for weighing the claims and evidence presented by parties in dispute to ensure equity, balance and fairness in order to arrive at final ruling or judgement.

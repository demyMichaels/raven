22. **CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA 1: PRE-INDEPENDENCE CONSTITUTIONS**

22.1 PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES

At the end of this chapter, students should be able to:
(1) Mention the pre-independence constitutions and their features.
(2) Outline the independence and post independence constitutions and their main features.
(3) Identify the common features in all the constitutions.

**Historical Background**
British colonial rule in West Africa started towards the end of 1898. Lagos was annexed and made a colony in 1861, Gold Coast in 1821, Freetown became a colony in 1808, etc. As from this period, the British government sought to establish and maintain a colonial state in Nigeria. In other words, Britian, decided to take over full colonial and administrative responsibility of Nigeria. To achieve this, therefore, a number of measures were to be taken, e.g. removal of all opposition to the imposition of colonial rule, expansion and consolidation of British authority over the territory that was later known as Nigeria. The British were also to gradually amalgamate the three different administrative units:
(i) The colony of Lagos.
(ii) The Protectorate of Southern Nigeria.
(iii) The Protectorate of Northern Nigeria.

Each of the units, had its own government and administration. In May 1906, Lagos Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria were joined together to form Lagos Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. Similarly, in 1914, Lagos Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria were amalgamated with Nothern Protectorate to form a single colony known as the Protectorate of Nigeria. In Britain, the minister responsible to the parliament for administration of colonies was the Secretary of State for the Colonies. He was equally responsible for administration of British colonial office. He appointed colonial governors on behalf of the home government.

22.2 CROWN COLONY SYSTEM
**Meaning:** This was a form of direct rule of British annexed territories in which the British established political institutions such as the executive council, legislative council and governor which were used in ruling the people who were regarded as British subjects. The crown colony system was headed by the governor

**Reasons Why The Crown Colony System Was Unpopular among the Educated Elite**

1. **Domination:** The legislative councils were dominated by the British in the 1920s.
2. **Dictatorship:** The governors were virtually colonial dictators as they had veto powers.
3. **Advisory bodies:** Executive councils were mere advisory bodies to the governors.
4. **Unofficial members:** The use of traditional rulers as unofficial members in the legislative councils.

275

(iv) The governor was the chairman of the executive and legislative councils.

2. The Executive Council  
(i) The executive council was responsible to the crown colony. Each crown colony was made up of officials who were mostly whites.  
(ii) The executive council was to advise the governor on administration but the governor had the power to accept or reject such advice.  
(iii) All the official members of the executive council were departmental heads, e.g. governor, chief secretary or colonial secretary, attorney-general, financial secretary and lieutenant-governors or chief commissioners.

3. The Legislative Council  
(i) The legislative council had official majority, e.g. the governor and members of the executive council who were all European officials.  
(ii) It had no legislative power, its role was purely advisory.  
(iii) The unofficial and the official members, e.g. European merchants, African chiefs and educated Africans were appointed by the governor.

22.3 FEATURES OF THE COLONIAL ADMINISTRATION IN THE CROWN COLONIES OF BRITISH WEST AFRICA

1. The Governor  
(i) The system of administration in the crown colonies of British West Africa was a direct administration headed by a governor.  
(ii) The governor was appointed from London and was responsible only to the Secretary of State for the Colonies who was based in London and also served as a British minister.  
(iii) The governor had veto and certification powers. He exercised this power over bills and advice from members of the executive and legislative councils.

276

5. Allocation of land: Allocation of land acquired by the government was approved by him.
6. Reserved powers: This was exercised by the governor in the area of law making, for example, power of veto and certification.

9. Ceremonial functions: He performed ceremonial functions, e.g. conferment of honours and receiving of dignitaries.
10. Responsibility: The governor was responsible to the Crown through the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

22.4 THE NIGERIAN COUNCIL
The council was created in 1914 after the amalgamation by Lord Lugard. Membership was 24 official and 12 unofficial members. The unofficial members were; 6 Europeans representing commerce, shipping, banking, mining, chambers of commerce and 6 Africans, made up of Sultan of Sokoto, Alaafin of Oyo, Emir of Kano, Chief Dogho Numa and a few educated Nigerians from Lagos and Calabar. The officials included members of the executive council, first class residents, political secretaries and secretaries of Southern and Northern provinces. This council was purely an advisory body. It had no power of legislation nor of finance. It was a medium for public opinion and not even an effective one in this regard. Most of the traditional rulers in the council could not see themselves as part of the issues of the council.

Even the educated Nigerians who were in an unofficial capacity did not play any vital role either. So, in 1922, Sir Hugh Clifford succeeded Lord Lugard as the Governor of Nigeria. He abolished the Nigerian council and in its place a new legislative council was set up for the whole of Southern Protectorate. The North was to be governed by proclamation coming from the governor.

22.5 THE NATIONAL CONGRESS OF BRITISH WEST AFRICA (NCBWA)
In 1920, the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA) was formed in Accra, Gold Coast (Ghana). Joseph Casely Hayford and Dr. Akinwande Savage of Nigeria were instrumental to its formation. One of the major demands of this body was the issue of granting elective principle. After the congress was constituted, it sent a delegation to London, to present a petition stating its demands to the then Secretary of State, Lord Milner.

The journey to London was an exercise in futility. The members were accused of self-centredness and that they represented no one but the educated class. The colonial office also argued that West Africans are not yet ripe for representative institutions and it would amount to foolhardiness allowing them this. However, Clifford, when setting up the legislative council, made a recommendation for granting of elective representation and this was granted by the new Secretary of State for the Colonies, Winston Churchill. Nigeria, then became the first country to adopt this principle.

Bourdillon. He was in office between 1939 and 1944. In 1939, the Northern and Southern  
protectorates were made provinces. Northern  
Nigeria remained a province and Southern  
Nigeria was broken into two – Eastern and  
Western provinces. At the time of Bourdillon’s  
retirement in 1944, he had almost concluded the  
new constitution, where he proposed,  
regionalism. So, Sir Richards Constitution of  
1946 replaced Clifford Constitution of 1922.  

Thenew constitution was published and tailored  
specifically to promote the unity of Nigeria and  
enhance greater participation of Nigerians in  
their own affairs.

7. And that, the constitution was imposed on the people of Nigeria.

2.14 THE MACPHERSON CONSTITUTION OF 1951

Sir John Macpherson became the new Governor of Nigeria after Richards and he made adequate arrangement not to repeat the mistake that led to the opposition and criticism that greeted Richards Constitution. So, in March, 1949, a select committee of the legislative council was set up to examine problems that may likely face the introduction of a new constitution.

The committee agreed that a wide measure of consultation with the people right from the village level, should be followed. Also, this was to be followed by a general conference, membership of which would involve all unofficial members of the legislative council and representatives of each regional council. Macpherson Constitution was assumed to be home made.

2.15 THE IBADAN ALL-NIGERIAN CONSTITUTIONAL CONFERENCE OF 1950

As part of Macpherson’s effort to come up with a durable and an acceptable constitution, an all-Nigerian constitutional conference was held in 1950 in Ibadan. The conference met in January 1950 and was chaired by sir Gerald Howe, the Attorney-General.

282

# Recommendations of the Conference

1. **A federal system:** This was to be composed of the three existing regions.

2. **Granting of autonomy:** Lagos should be made an independent municipality.

5. **Allocation of seats in parliament:** Apart from the recommendations made by the conference, the northern delegation demanded that half of the seats in parliament be allocated to their region. This was objected by delegates from the West and East which they claimed would amount to their absolute control of the centre.

6. **Revenue allocation:** Similarly, northern delegates recommended that revenue from taxation should be allocated to the regions based on per capita.

7. **Committee:** This was constituted to look into the problems of regional representation at the centre. It recommended that House of Representatives should have 148 elected members and that half should be from the north. Six others to represent other interests not proportionally represented in the parliament. The Legislative Council accepted and approved the recommendations.

## 22.16 MAIN FEATURES OF MACPHERSON CONSTITUTION

Membership was 148 and 136 of them were to be elected by the Nigerian members of the Regional legislature. 68 representatives from the North, 34 representatives each from the Eastern and Western Houses of Assembly. 6 members were to be appointed by the governor to represent those not properly represented and the other 6 would be ex-officio members (the three lieutenant-governors, the chief secretary, the financial secretary, and the attorney-general). Laws made must be assented to by the governor before they could become laws. However, this House had limited powers. It had no power over bills relating to public service and public revenue and this was because the governor possessed wide reserved powers.

2. **Council of ministers:** The governor was the president of this council, others were 6 official members charged with issues relating to civil service, defence, legal matters, etc. and 12 ministers, 4 representing each region and to come from House of Representatives.

3. **The regional legislature:** The Northern and Western regions each had a bi-cameral legislature – Houses of Assembly and Chiefs. The Eastern Region had only a House of Assembly. Each regional legislature had the power to make laws on some specific matters, e.g. local matters, cooperative societies, social welfare, local

### 2.18 WEAKNESSES OF MACPHERSON CONSTITUTION

1. **The existence of Regional/Ethnic politics:** This factor had succeeded in weakening the central legislature e.g. the representatives at the centre were more

2. No responsible government at the centre: The constitution made no provision for a responsible government at the centre, e.g. the ministers were not given portfolios, but could initiate discussions of policy in the council.

3. Crisis in the Eastern House of Assembly: The exclusion of Nnamdi Azikive from the central legislature led to the crisis in the Eastern House of Assembly.

4. The motion for self-government: Chief Anthony Enahoro in 1953, moved the motion in the House of Representatives requesting for self-government for Nigeria in 1956. The motion was rejected by Northern politicians and it caused bad blood between Northern and Southern politicians.

5. Kano riot of 1953: This riot demonstrated the weakness and failures of Macpherson Constitution.

6. Veto power: The 1951 constitution still provided for an all powerful governor with veto power to legislate on any matter in the country.

15. Electoral system: No uniform electoral system. North had adult male suffrage while East and West had universal adult suffrage

22.19 THE LONDON CONSTITUTIONAL CONFERENCE OF 1953
The Colonial Secretary, Mr Oliver Lyttleton, informed the British House of Commons on May 20, 1953 about the situation in Nigeria. He maintained that events had shown that the three regions could not work together in a federation as was then structured. He suggested that the British government should invite representatives of the regions to London to discuss a redrafting of the Nigerian Constitution and that issues within the jurisdiction of the regions should not be subject to the central government’s intervention. So, a new constitutional conference, as recommended by the Colonial Secretary,

Reasons for the Setting Up

The commission had to look into the grievances of minority groups and their agitations for separate states and make recommendations. However, the commission claimed that there were two genuine fears among the minorities:

2. Regional governments did not secure in its majority the commitment to meet the wishes of the minorities.

Major Recommendations

1. Creation of more states: The commission recommended that the problems of the minorities could not be solved by creation of more states.

2. The police: A strong united police force under federal authorities was recommended.

3. Fundamental human rights: The need to entrench the fundamental human rights in the constitution to safeguard the interests of the minority.

4. Muslim laws: Non-muslims in the North not willing to be tried under muslim laws should have the option of being tried in a non-muslim court of justice.

5. Existing boundary: This commission recommended that no change should be made in the existing boundary between Northern and Western Regions, any change should come through plebiscite.

6. Annual reports: Annual reports for both the special and minority areas were to be submitted to the House of Representatives and the appropriate Regional Houses.

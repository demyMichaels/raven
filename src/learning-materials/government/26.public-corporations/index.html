**17.9 PRIVATISATION**
Privatisation is a policy of the government created to afford individuals, corporate bodies, the opportunity to take over ownership and control of government enterprises, companies, etc.

**Reasons for Privatisation**
1. **To introduce efficient management:** Individuals and other bodies are efficient in the management of enterprises than the government.
2. **Individual participation:** The forum is created for individual participation and ownership of industries or enterprises in the country’s economic system.
3. **More revenue for the government:** More revenue now accrues to the government through individual or collective participation.
4. **Unproductive industries:** The system accommodates competition and so, unproductive industries or enterprises may not survive the day.
5. **Industrial autonomy:** Because the industries or companies are privatised and commercialised, provision of autonomy is made possible in the system.
6. **Consumer’s choice:** To create an opportunity for consumers to buy goods based on choice.

**Merits of Privatisation**
1. **Efficiency in management:** Privatisation promotes efficiency in the management of most enterprises or industries.
2. **Increase in revenue:** More revenue will be generated for the government through privatisation.
3. **Innovations:** Innovations are injected into the production and rendering of high-quality products and efficient services to the people.
4. **Competition:** The system is open to individual and collective participation, resulting in competition among emerging investors.
5. **Consumers’ choice:** Consumers have enough choice to make in the purchase of goods and services.

**Demerits of Privatisation**
1. **Profit maximisation:** This policy will lead to high cost of produced goods and services aimed essentially at profit maximisation on the part of the producers.
2. **Low standard of living of the masses:** The masses will experience a low or poor standard of living because most of the enterprises or companies would want to maximise their profits.
3. **Reduction in labour force:** Privatisation may bring about reduction in the workforce or labour force of most companies, thereby increasing the already saturated labour market.
4. **Income not evenly distributed:** Income is usually not evenly distributed as a result of this policy and this is because a few individuals (producers) are now in control of the means of production of goods and services.
5. **Neglect in consumer’s welfare scheme:** With privatisation, people’s welfare schemes are not adequately catered for or implemented.
6. **Strike or demonstration:** Privatisation usually produces conflict between the employers (producers) and the workers especially in the area of workers’ total emolument. When dialogue between them fails, strike becomes the inevitable tool for workers. Strike is the refusal to work.

**17.10 COMMERCIALISATION**
This is a state policy of making its companies, enterprises, parastatals, etc. more efficient and even more profit-oriented. It will also make these organisations come up with efficient management of resources.

**Reasons for Commercialisation**
1. **Efficient management:** Commercialisation makes for efficient management of most industries.
2. **Collective or individual ownership of enterprises:** An opportunity is created for collective or individual’s participation in the country’s economic activities.
3. **Revenue generation:** More revenues are generated for the government through commercialisation.
4. **Extinction of enterprises:** Commercialisation creates the opening for the economy to experience the extinction or exit of enterprises that are unproductive.
5. **Profit-oriented:** Efficient and effective management of industries, enterprises, etc. could result in making them more profit-oriented.

**Merits of Commercialisation**
1. **Efficiency:** Efficiency in production is one of the gains of commercialisation.
2. **Generation of more revenues:** More revenues are generated for the three tiers of government: local, state and federal governments.
3. **Reduction of expenditures:** Observed that most public enterprises are not viable, the expenditure on them will be reduced drastically.
4. **Introduction of new ideas:** Competition makes way for the injection of innovations, new ideas, etc. into most of the enterprises, industries, etc.
5. **Wide range of choices for consumers:** This policy is a creation of abundant products in the system, bringing about wide-range of choices for the consumers.
6. **Profit-making venture:** The target set in commercialisation is always the tendency towards profit-making.

**Demerits of Commercialisation**
1. **Cost of produced goods is high:** This may be out of the reach of the consumers. This is because the high cost of produced goods is passed to consumers as a result of the company’s set objective which is profit maximisation.
2. **Fall in people’s standard of living:** Commercialisation in most cases leads to a drastic fall in people’s standard of living. This is a result of most organisations’ policy of profit maximisation over and above the economic well-being of the people, even by exploiting them.
3. **Laying off workers:** There is always a reduction of workforce in many industries as a result of commercialisation.
4. **Consumers’ welfare scheme under threat:** Consumers’ welfare schemes are mostly neglected owing to commercialisation.
5. **Uneven distribution of income:** Income is unevenly distributed as a result of the policy of commercialisation. Few people now control the means of production of goods and services in the system.

17.11 DEREGULATION**
**Meaning:** Deregulation is the process of removing state regulations. It is therefore opposite of regulation which refers to the process of the government regulating certain activities. It is also seen as the reduction or elimination of government power in a particular industry, usually to create more competition within the industry.

**Advantages of Deregulation**
1. **Competitiveness:** The stated rationale for deregulation is often that fewer and simpler regulations will lead to a raised level of competitiveness, therefore, higher productivity, more efficiency and lower prices overall.
2. **Access to credit markets:** Deregulation can enable consumers to gain easier access to credit markets. It boosts spending on consumer durables such as cars, etc.
3. **Generated savings:** The biggest gain will be in savings generated from divesting in the sector. This will free up government funds for other activities.
4. **Efficiency:** As long as government regulation is removed, it will enhance efficiency in running most of the industries.
5. **Wider choice for consumers:** In the provision of goods and services, consumers will have wider and sufficient choice to make.
6. **New Ideas:** New ideas will be injected into the economy as a result of competition. High-quality products and services will definitely be the outcome.

**Disadvantages of Deregulation**
1. **Opposition:** Opposition deregulation may usually involve apprehension regarding environmental pollution and environmental quality standards such as the removal of regulations on hazardous materials, financial uncertainty and constraining monopolies.
2. **Maximisation of profits:** Removal of regulation may lead to a high cost of production of goods and services and return consumers may likely pay more for the products. Most of these industries would want to maximise their profits.
3. **Poor quality products:** This may result because laws governing quality standards have been removed.
4. **Retrenchment:** Deregulation may equally result in retrenchment of the workforce.
5. **Poor living standard:** This may also come up because people are now paying more for goods and services.

**Effects of Deregulation and Privatisation**
1. **Potential savings in the downstream sector:** They are defined as the difference between the actual cost of supplying petroleum products to consumers either through imports or by refining crude.
2. **Capital market development:** The key issues in the impact or effect of privatisation when sold are those of profitability, efficiency, unemployment and capital market development.
3. **Non-profitability:** This is likely to occur once the refineries are old but may be due to debts written off by government, in order to give the company a fresh start.
4. **Efficiency:** Normally, after deregulation and privatisation, state-owned enterprises return to being efficient as costs are reduced and redundant employees are retrenched.
5. **Unemployment:** This cannot be avoided, but government can create effect so as to handle welfare matters arising.
6. **Cost of living:** It has increased the cost of living, made the cost of transportation high and even created job opportunities.

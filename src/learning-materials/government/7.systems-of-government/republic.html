 REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT**

**Definition:** A republican form of government can be defined as a sovereign state headed by a president, elected for a fixed term of office. Unlike a monarchy, succession to the office of Head of state is non-hereditary but elective. It is a representative democracy in which government is by the consent of the people. Nigeria, so far, has succeeded in operating four republics. The first was between 1963 and 1966; the second was between 1979 and 1983 and the third was aborted and the fourth was from 1999—till date. In the First Republic, Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe was elected as President (a ceremonial Head of state) in a parliamentary or cabinet system of government.

In the Second Republic (1979 - 83), Alhaji Shehu Shagari was elected Executive President for the country as both head of state and government under a presidential system of government. Similarly, the Third Republic was truncated under Ibrahim Babangida. In the Fourth Republic, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo was elected president, head of state and government (1999: 2007). The Fourth Republic is still in operation in Nigerian. The current head of state and government in Nigeria is President Muhammad Bahari (2015 till date). Cameroun, Niger, Chad, USA, India, etc. are examples of republican governments.

**CONSTITUTION**
Definition:

A constitution is defined 
as a body of agreed rules and principles
 stating how
 the powers of governing a country
 are given and 
how these powers are to be exercised.

 It also establishes a basic framework or fundamental law of the land. 

By so doing, it checks and sets limits not only to the actions of government but also to the actions of ordinary citizens. 
The constitution also states the rights, duties and obligations of the citizens.



**SOURCES OF CONSTITUTION**
1. History of the people:
 It is necessary that the history of the people should be considered in preparing the basic rules that govern them. Past political developments do form a part of their history.

2. Acts of parliament:
 The laws or enactments by parliaments form part of constitutional framing.

3. Customs and traditions: 
They are the beliefs, institutions, norms and values of the people, and these are important in the formulation of the constitution.

4. Pasteonstitutions: 
Past constitutions of Nigeria and other countries most often form the basis of any new constitution. 
For example, the American Constitution provided a model for the 1979 Constitution of Nigeria.

5. Conventions: 
These are accepted political precepts and practices which often form a part of the instruments of a country’s constitution.

6. Constitutional conferences: 
These are meetings at which difficult constitutional issues are discussed and resolved in preparation for a new constitution. Decisions at such conferences often form the basis for a new constitution.

7. Judicial precedents: 
These are past judgements at law courts on constitutional matters and they often form the basis for a new constitution.



**4.4 FEATURES OF A CONSTITUTION**

**4.5 TYPES OF CONSTITUTION**
Written
Unwritten
Rigid
Flexible



**Written Constitution**
**Definition:** 
A written constitution is defined as a document or set of documents establishing the selection of rules embodied in a document in which the fundamental principles concerning the organisation of a political system and powers of its various agencies are written down and codified. 
Thus, the constitution of the USA (1789) outlines the composition of the legislature, the executive and the judiciary and their powers, as well as the fundamental rights of citizens. It also mentions a method for its amendment.



**Reasons Why some Countries Adopt Written Constitution or Merits of Written Constitution**

1. **Proper documentation:**
 It allows for proper documentation and entrenchment of fundamental human rights.

2. **It plays the fear of domination:** 
It protects the minority interests against the domination by the majority.

3. **Procedure for amendment:** 
This is clearly stated so that no one group can change the constitution to suit their selfish purpose.

4. **Prevention of conflict in the exercise of power:**m This is possible because the constitution has stated clearly and separately the powers and functions of each organ of government.

5. **Provision of a means of assessment:**
 It helps in measuring and assessing the performance of government as the principles governing their operations are written down.

6. **For ease of reference:** 
For example, judges in the law courts can easily turn to it while deciding cases.

7. **It is easily available:** 
Since it is a single document, it can easily be obtained and
.

8. It ensures political stability: Since it is a single document, the method of acquiring power is clearly stated. This makes for political stability.

9. Removal of uncertainty: The uncertainty usually experienced with unwritten constitution is absent here. This constitution is written and documented.

10. Unconstitutional act: In a written constitution, it is easy to ascertain unconstitutional acts. Powers and functions of organs and tiers of government are clearly defined. If there is a breach, the judiciary has the power to stop or question such unconstitutional act from any of the organs or tiers of government.

11. Organs of government: A written constitution clearly defines the powers and functions of each organ of government.
12. Emergence of dictatorship: It prevents the possible emergence of dictatorship.



**Demerits of a Written Constitution**
1. Written constitutions are generally rigid: They are not easily adaptable to changing situations.
2. Discouragement of reforms: The process of amendment can take a very long time and this may discourage necessary reforms.
3. Change cannot be effected quickly: Change cannot be effected quickly as the people might desire.
4. Types of government: A written constitution may not fully accommodate different types of government, for instance, a unitary form of government.
5. Tendency to cause political tension: This may result if it does not favour a disaffection and bad blood within the political system.
6. Frequent conflict: Written constitution can cause frequent conflict among the three arms of government, especially if their functions are not properly defined.
7. A reference point: It is written and can easily be referred to, resulting in litigation as often as possible between individuals, individuals against the government, etc., especially when their rights are trampled upon.



**Unwritten Constitution**
Definition: It is defined as one in which the fundamental principles of the organisation and powers of a government are not codified in one document. It is usually a combination of statutes, judicial principles, customs and conventions which guide the operation of government. The constitution of Great Britain is a good example.

However, the English (Britain) has left different parts of their constitution without attempting to bring them together, to classify or codify them into a coherent whole. For example, the Magna Carta Act of 1215, the Bill of Rights of 1689, Reform Act of 1832, Parliaments Acts of 1911 and 1949 respectively are part of the British Constitution that were written down but not codified in one document.

**Merits of Unwritten Constitution**
1. It is flexible: It does not require special procedure for its amendment. It can be done in the same way ordinary laws are made.
2. It can be changed quickly: Since it is flexible, it can be changed as quickly as the people might desire.
3. Few individual cases: Cases involving

individuals, institutions, etc. may not be as frequent as in a written constitution.

4. **Quick decisions:** Decisions are easily made and taken too.

5. **Easy to interpret:** It is flexible and not rigid and so, the constitution can easily be interpreted.

6. **Issue of flexibility:** This can help to reduce friction among the three organs of government.

7. **Emergencies:** Flexible constitutions are suitable in time of emergencies.

## Demerits of Unwritten Constitution

1. **No checks and balances:** An unwritten constitution does not have checks and balances which are usually entrenched in written constitution.

2. **Arbitrary government:** This could be made possible in the exercise of powers and functions by political leaders.

3. **Encouragement of arbitrary changes:** Since the parliament is supreme, an unwritten constitution creates way for them to act arbitrarily; they have the power to manipulate and change the constitution easily.

4. **Not easily known:** Since the customs, conventions, statutes, etc. making up an unwritten constitution are not contained in a single document, they are not easily known.

5. **No ease of reference:** It cannot be easily turned to or studied the way we study a written constitution.

6. **Violation of the rights of citizens:** This could be made possible in the process of arbitrary changes of the constitution.

7. **Violation of rights:** Lack of codification of fundamental rights of citizens undermines the ability to seek redress when rights are violated.

8. **Ambiguities:** An unwritten constitution creates ambiguities which can lead to general misinterpretations.

9. **Unsuitability:** An unwritten constitution is not suitable for multi-ethnic/multi-nacial societies.

10. **Unconstitutional acts:** It is not easy to ascertain unconstitutional acts of some public officers even among the three organs of government.

11. **Emergence of conflicts:** There is possible emergence of conflicts among the organs of government due to none definition of their roles and powers.

## Methods of Amendment of Constitution
Constitutions should have the ability to change with time and circumstances. Classification of constitutions, therefore, is dependent on the method of amendment.

There are two different methods of amending a constitution and these are:
(1) Rigid constitution
(2) Flexible constitution.


### Rigid constitution
Rigid constitution is defined as one that is very difficult to amend or change. It requires a special process or a complicated method before it can be amended or changed. Most written constitutions are rigid. USA, Ghana, Nigeria, Australia, etc. have rigid constitutions.


### Rigid constitutions are of four types:
1. Where the legislature could be involved in some constitutional amendment with some restrictions and at the same time may go through the electorate (referendum) before adoption.

2. Secondly, the method by which the consent of the majority of the voters is needed for constitutional amendment.

3. Final decision is undertaken by the majority of the component units or regions in a federal set-up. For example, 3/4 of the majority of states in the USA are needed for such amendment.

4. The development of new customs in the course of time or final decisions in the hands of an outside authority, e.g. leaving such decisions to the sovereign in parliament in Britain.



## Advantages of a Rigid Constitution
1. Enhancement of individuals rights: These rights are not subject to arbitrary change by the government. Adequate consideration is mostly given to the people when a change is sought.

2. Political stability: It makes way for political stability in a country. This is because of the laid down procedure for constitutional changes.

3. Reduction of violent or revolutionary intentions: It reduces violent or revolutionary intention to the barest minimum.

4. It is a check: A rigid method of amendment is a check against rash and hasty decisions. Issues have to be properly examined before actions are taken on them.

5. It serves as a restraint: A rigid constitution restrains or prevents unscrupulous politicians from manipulating the constitution to achieve selfish or sectional ends.



## Disadvantages of a Rigid Constitution
1. **Delay to rapid growth:** It is a delay to rapid growth and development. A cross-section of the citizens are consulted before amendments are made or introduced.
2. **Abuse of rights:** The democratic rights of the people may be abused or trampled upon.
3. **Complicated method of amendment:** The method of amendment is complicated and so cannot be reasonably adopted in times of emergencies.
4. **Innovations:** Rigid constitutions are resistant to change and innovations.
5. **Slow economic growth:** The amendment of a rigid constitution may lead to slow economic growth and development.



## Flexible Constitution
**Definition:** It is defined as the type of constitution that is easy to amend. If the method of amending the constitution is the same as that of the passing of ordinary law, the constitution is said to be flexible. Again, the amendment can easily be done by a simple majority in the legislature.

Britain, Italy, etc. have flexible constitutions. However, a flexible constitution may be written or unwritten. It is, however, opposite in some ways to rigid constitution. The constitutions of Great Britain and Italy are not written but are flexible constitutions.


## Merits of a Flexible Constitution
1. **It can easily be changed:** This is easily done to meet with fresh and unforeseen contingencies.
2. **Decision-making:** It helps government to take a quick action or decision.
3. **Introduction of new laws:** Obsolete laws can easily be replaced with new ones.
4. **It can easily meet with people's needs:** The needs and aspirations of the people can easily be met because of the ease in amending the constitution.


## Demerits of a Flexible constitution
1. **Manipulation:** The provisions of the constitution can easily be manipulated by a powerful leader.
2. **Unsuitable for a federal set-up:** This is because the rights of autonomy of some states may be jeopardised by some radical reforms.
3. **Rights of individuals:** Fundamental rights of individuals may be infringed upon and may increase the fears of the minority and inter-ethnic disharmony.
4. **Different interests and opinions:** Different interests and opinions may not be promoted but could be suppressed.
5. **Sectional interest:** A section of the country can use its influence or position to amend the constitution to achieve sectional interest.


## Differences between rigid and flexible constitutions

| Rigid    | Flexible    |
|---|---|
| 1. A rigid constitution is one that is very difficult to amend. | A flexible constitution is one that is very easy to amend. |
| 2. The process of amendment is a complicated method. | The amendment can easily be done by a simple majority in the legislature. |
| 3. Most written constitutions are rigid. | A flexible constitution may be written or unwritten. |
| 4. The provision cannot be easily manipulated because there is a procedure legally laid down for its amendment. | The provisions of the constitution can easily be manipulated by a powerful leader. |
| 5. Rigid constitutions are resistant to change and innovations. | Changes and innovations can easily be brought in |

It is not suitable for a federal set-up. This is because the rights of autonomy of some of the units may be jeopardised by some radical reforms.

Political stability is not as pronounced as in rigid constitution. Issues about governance are not clearly defined.

Flexible constitutions are suitable in time of emergencies.

There is possibility of an arbitrary government to evolve

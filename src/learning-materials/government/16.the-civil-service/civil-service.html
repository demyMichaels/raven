**16.2 THE CIVIL SERVICE**
**Meaning:** The civil service is a body or department in the executive arm of government. It has the duty of assisting the executive in the planning and implementation of government policies. The civil service is divided into departments called ministries, for example, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Information, Ministry of Finance, etc. The political head and chief executive of a ministry is either a minister or a commissioner. The Director-General (Permanent Secretary) is the administrative head and the Accounting Officer of a ministry.
Public corporations, the police, armed forces, etc. are not part of the civil service but public service. The civil service is different from the public service in terms of conditions of service. A worker in the civil service is called a civil servant. The change from permanent secretary to Director-General effected in Babangida’s administration was reverted to permanent secretary in Abacha’s administration. There are state civil services as well as federal civil service.

**16.3 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CIVIL SERVICE**

2. **Permanence:** It is an institution that does not change with the government. Workers equally enjoy a permanent tenure of office.
3. **Anonymity:** A civil servant is not expected to reveal or speak to the Press unless authorised by the minister or Director-General. Credit or failure of the government on any issue is not blamed on the civil servants but the minister.
4. **Neutrality:** Workers in the service are not expected to engage themselves in partisan politics unless they resign their appointments.
5. **Expertise:** Experts are produced in the field of administration. This is because they put in long years of service.

Of course. Here is the content from the provided images, continuing the chapter on the Civil Service and related institutions, rearranged into a logical and coherent structure while maintaining the verbatim text.

**(...Continued from previous section)**

**16.7 FACTORS THAT CAN HINDER THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CIVIL SERVICE IN NIGERIA**
4. **Political interference:** Politicians are always involved in interfering with the planning and implementation of the policies of government.
5. **Tribalism, nepotism and favouritism:** These can lead to the appointment of unqualified personnel into the service.
6. **Political instability:** Frequent military intervention affects policy-making and implementation.
7. **Bribery and corruption:** Most civil servants seek undue gratification for any work done. Not only that, kickbacks and corruption are cankerworms that have eaten deep into the fabric of the civil service.
8. **Over-duplication of functions:** Functions exercised in the civil service are overduplicated, resulting in redundancy and idleness.

**16.8 CONTINUITY OF THE CIVIL SERVICE**
One important and unique role of the civil service is that it stands for the continuity of policy in government. If the role is maintained, the civil service can therefore be described as a corrective part of government, irrespective of the political party in power. Its task is to lay the national issues and their point of view before each minister that comes for consideration. In this way, the civil service observes strict political neutrality, while ensuring the continuity of policies based on over all national interest.

**16.9 HOW TO ENSURE THE POLITICAL NEUTRALITY OF THE CIVIL SERVICE**
1. **Members of the civil service must abstain from party politics:** Civil servants must be neutral and loyalty given to any party in government; they must be within the limits of the law.
2. **To observe strict official secrecy:** Civil servants must observe strict official secrecy and must be obedient to their official duties.
3. **The political executive should have limited control over them:** The appointment of permanent officials should not be fully handled by the political executive because that might lead to party patronage, favouritism and insecurity of service.
4. **Minister is responsible for success/ failure of the service:** The minister should take the responsibility for the action of his subordinates in the service.
5. **Participation in politics:** A civil servant can only play partisan politics after resigning from the service. He should be neutral as long as he remains in service.
6. **Merit:** Those to be recruited into the civil service (through open competition or interviews) should be on merit, not on political leverage.
7. **Neutral body:** The civil service commission should be a neutral body. It should be free from the control of the executive and other self-seeking political leaders.
8. **Faithfulness and openness:** As the civil servant must carry out the decisions and policies laid down by the political boss, e.g. Minister, he must resist illegitimate political demands or pressures.

**16.10 CONTROL OF THE CIVIL SERVICE**
1. **Control of recruitment, promotional discipline:** Civil service commission controls recruitment, promotion, discipline, etc. of civil servants. Recruitment, promotional discipline by the commission are a form of control.
2. **Ministry of finance control:** The position of the ministry of finance in budgeting, salaries, etc. gives it strategic leverage as a control agency.
3. **Parliamentary control:** This control is in the form of supply of money to the civil service and the power it has to accept or reject appointments of top civil servants by the executive.
4. **Executive control:** The power to appoint top civil servants is an important means of executive control.
5. **Hierarchical structure and control:** The hierarchy of power in the service must be obeyed and respected by every civil servant, for example, a Director General exercising control over the workers under him.
6. **Legal / judicial control:** It includes the machinery and procedure for dealing with administrative corruption as well as control to ensure impartial and efficient administration. It is also directed at some top officials exceeding the authority that has been given them.
7. **Ombudsman (Public Complaints Commission):** It examines complaints of maladministration among civil servants.

**Bureaucracy**
It is a pattern of administration involving government departments in which complicated official routine is observed in the conduct of public affairs and in the activities of public officials. It is laying much emphasis on issues that demand urgent attention.
Bureaucracy is associated with inefficiency, lack of initiative, unnecessary rigidity in the approach to public problems but, to some extent, these problems are inseparable from administration because it is a process and an element of administration.

**Causes of Bureaucracy**
1. **Complex nature of most modern and democratic states:** Services rendered in most modern and democratic states are complex which involve formulation, implementation of rules and regulations as well as division of labour. All these are hierarchical (system of persons or things arranged in graded order).
2. **Accountability:** Another cause is the issue of accountability. Public officers are very careful about this and avoid making mistakes that will expose them to public criticism and condemnation. So, the outcome is that care is taken to examine all issues before them critically, resulting in a process which slows down action.
3. **Close relationship between size of an organisation and bureaucracy:** There is a close relationship between size of an organisation and bureaucracy. In a big organisation, the shift is towards a strict adherence to issues with far-reaching objectivity coming into play. In a small organisation, attention to issues is quickly expedited with promptness.
4. **Specialisation:** Another point is the issue of specialisation. This is very important when implementing issues that are complex. Specialisation is restricting and it narrows the individuals’ activities.
5. **Organisation:** Another point of reckoning is organisation. This is because it provides the necessary structuring in hierarchical order of functions and personnel. It helps every worker to know where he or she fits in and whom he or she is responsible to. With this arrangement, rigidity and inflexibility set in, resulting in red-tapism (bureaucracy).

**Arguments in Favour of Bureaucracy**
1. It is seen as indispensable and ensures efficiency especially in large organisations.
2. It is a necessary instrument in areas of adequate planning, control and even implementation.
3. It makes for strict adherence to rules and regulations governing most institutions or organisations.
4. It produces some level of competence on the part of a worker.

**16.11 THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION**
It is an independent body with members holding office based on good behaviour and is set up by the government and entrusted with the duty of recruiting men into the service by open competition supplemented by interviews in some cases. The commission also handles promotion, discipline and dismissal of civil servants. The body is made up of a chairman and other members so appointed.

**16.12 FUNCTIONS OF THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION**
1. **Recruitment:** It is empowered to recruit high level manpower into the civil service through open competition and by interview.
2. **Transfer:** The commission also has the power to transfer civil servants from one ministry to another within the civil service.
3. **Promotion:** It promotes civil servants from one salary scale to another. This is done especially when the civil servants due for promotion.
4. **Discipline:** This body is equally empowered to discipline civil servants who disobey the rules and regulations governing the service.
5. **Retirement:** It has to retire those civil servants that have reached the stipulated retirement age.
6. **Dismissal:** The commission has the power to dismiss erring civil servants found to be corrupt or involved in negative acts contrary to the rules and regulations of the service.
7. **Conditions of service:** The commission has succeeded in stating down, terms and conditions of service, allowances and remunerations of the civil service.
8. **Advice:** This body advises the government in areas of appointment of very senior officers of the state departments and parastatals.
9. **Efficiency and integrity:** These are the watchwords in the civil service and so, the commission sees to its realisation.
10. **Training and scholarship:** The commission organises scholarship and training schemes for the civil servants to broaden their knowledge and to improve their efficiency.
11. **Grievances:** It sets up panels to look into grievances of workers including their remunerations and conditions of service.

**16.13 THE POLICE FORCE**

This body is responsible for recruitment, promotion, discipline and dismissal of members of the force. The police is seen as a paramilitary and a department of the executive arm of government. The Nigeria Police Force is under the control of the president of the country. The overall head of the police force in Nigeria is the Inspector General of Police and at the state level, a Commissioner of Police is in charge.

**16.15 PROBLEMS/Failures OF THE POLICE FORCE**
1. **Not properly equipped:** The police is not properly equipped with modern gadgets in crime detection.
2. **Bribery and corruption:** It is a cankerworm that has eaten deep into the fabric of the force.
3. **Aiding and abetting crime:** The police have been accused on several occasions of aiding and abetting crime in the society. For example, they supply arms to robbers.

7. **Poor funding:** The police is poorly funded by the government. This can affect performance.
8. **Inadequate personnel:** The number of men and women in the force is still very low compared to the population of the country.

**16.16 OMBUDSMAN**
**Meaning:** Ombudsman is a government institution established to examine complaints of inefficient administration, corruption and unjustified treatment by over-realous public authorities or officials against citizens. Ombudsman is also known as the Public Complaints Commission. It was introduced in Sweden in 1809. Norway, New Zealand, Finland, Denmark, Great Britain, etc. have this institution in place.

THE RULE OF LAW**

**Definition:** 
The rule of law is defined as the supremacy of law over everybody in a political system. Rule of law is seen as a provision made by the constitution with emphasis on supremacy of the law, equality before the law and the presence or inclusion of the principle of individual rights. The law should be able to guide every individual and activities in a state. According to Professor A.V. Dicey, the political leaders that are entrusted with the affairs of the state should abide by the rule of law and govern the people according to the provisions of the constitution of that particular country. He maintained that when this is respected, there will be absence of arbitrary government. In addition, powers in government, should not be concentrated in the hands of a few individual but should be exercised by different institutions to make for good governance.

**Principles of the Rule of Law**
The following are the principles of the rule of law as propounded by Professor A.V. Dicey.

1.  **Principle of equality:** It states that laws should apply equally to all citizens of a country, irrespective of their economic or political status. Nobody should be above the law. Also, access to legal facilities should be granted to all.

2.  **Principle of impartiality:** This principle is of the view that the law should be impartial in dealing with offenders. This means that no person should be punished for any offence until otherwise established by the court. Any accused person is still regarded as a suspect by law, and should not be detained for more than 24 hours, without producing the individual in court.

3.  **Principle of individual rights:** Every human being is entitled to an exercise of fundamental rights and freedom and that when these rights are violated, citizens should have the right to seek redress from the courts. Only the courts have the jurisdiction to entertain such cases.

**Additional Features of the rule of law**

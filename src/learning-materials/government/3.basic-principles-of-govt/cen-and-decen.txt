CENTRALISATION**

**Definition:** Centralisation is defined as the process by which political power is located in a single central decision-making body. The highest degree of centralisation is achieved where all powers of government are vested in a central authority. The degree of centralisation is highest in a unitary state. Britain, France, etc. are centralised states.
In some political systems, they may see the need for some degree of centralisation of power.

**Reasons for the Adoption of Centralisation**

1.  **Best practised in a homogeneous state:** This system is best practised where there are no sharp differences in religion, language, beliefs, etc.
2.  **Small country:** It is easy to practise in a relatively small country where the government has representatives from every ethnic group in the society.
3.  **Delegation of functions:** The central government can delegate powers and functions to other component units.
4.  **Power concentration:** All the powers and authorities of the state are concentrated in the hands of the central government.
5.  **Flexibility:** The constitution of a centralised state is flexible.
6.  **Power to modify the constitution:** The central government may have the power to modify the constitution in the same process used to pass laws. Britain adopts this method.
7.  **No constitutional division of power:** There is no constitutional division of power between the central government and other component units.
8.  **Strong central government:** This is because it has all the powers of the state and the people give support to it only.
9.  **No conflict of authority:** Since all the powers are in the hands of the central government, conflict in the exercise of these functions will not arise.

**Advantages of Centralisation**

1.  **Decision-making powers:** Sometimes, there may be the need to withdraw decision-making powers from subordinate units to make for a more coherent and efficient administration.
2.  **Cost:** The cost of running a centralised administration is relatively lower than the decentralised administration. The reason is that functions are not duplicated.
3.  **It makes for quick action:** Quick action is made in the areas of decision-making and implementation. The central government alone makes decisions.
4.  **Flexible constitution:** The method of amending the constitution is relatively easy because the constitution is flexible.
5.  **Makes for a strong government:** A centralised state is stronger than a decentralised one, because all the powers are concentrated in the hands of single central authority.
6.  **No conflict of authority:** There can be no conflict of authority or confusion regarding responsibility for work to be done.
7.  **Co-ordination of functions:** Centralisation makes for effective coordination of functions in both human and material resources.
8.  **Prevention of waste:** It prevents waste, inefficiency and a high level of indiscipline in both the civil and public services.
9.  **Less bureaucratic:** Centralisation is less bureaucratic and simple to operate.
10. **Unity:** A centralised government unites different groups of diverse opinions and interests in the society.

**Disadvantages of Centralisation**

1.  **Remoteness:** It makes for remoteness of decision-making centre from where the decisions are to be implemented.
2.  **Rigidity and inflexible response:** It may lead to rigidity and inflexible response to local needs and problems.
3.  **Stagnation:** Centralised government may also make for stagnation at the local level, because the centre cannot quickly respond to the problems.
4.  **Dictatorship:** Centralisation may encourage dictatorship in the system.
5.  **Small territories:** It is only workable in small territories. This system may not work in countries like Nigeria and USA.
6.  **Homogeneous society:** Centralisation can also work only in a homogeneous society, where differences in culture, tribes, etc. are not well pronounced.
7.  **Interest groups:** It is not possible for centralisation to accommodate every interest group in the system.
8.  **Amendment of the constitution:** The central government alone can easily amend the constitution for selfish purposes.
9.  **Political participation and decision-making:** The people are not politically active and adequately involved in the decision-making process of the country.
10. **Secession:** The concentration of power may favour a particular tribe or group and this may create bad blood in the system. The result of this could be secession or break away of a part.

#### **6.20 DECENTRALISATION**

**Definition:** Decentralisation has to do with the sharing of powers between the central government and other constituent units, within political system. Powers are, therefore, distributed to these different units, thereby creating many centres of power. For example, in a decentralised political system, powers are constitutionally shared between the central government and other constituent units, e.g. state and local governments. Details in power sharing are fully discussed in chapter three under the topic Federal System of Government. Nigeria, USA, etc. have decentralised political systems.

**Types of Decentralisation**
There are two types of decentralisation and they are:
1.  Devolution
2.  Deconcentration.

**1. Devolution**

**Meaning:** In this type of system, the central government may decide to set up or create constituent or subordinate levels of government in different parts of the country, with powers to make decisions in specified areas as related to the locality. Britain is a good example.

**2. Deconcentration**

**Meaning:** In this system, the central government sets policies for the local areas, appoints some officials with some powers and authority, and delegates them to carry out specific functions, thereby regulating government policies at the local government level. France is a good example.

**Note:** Reasons for the adoption of decentralisation have been discussed already in chapter three under the topic - **Reasons for the Adoption of a Federal State.**

**Merits of Decentralisation**

1.  **Quick development:** Quick development is achieved in a decentralised system because in this system, there is an opportunity for development. Every unit has the tendency to develop even faster than others.
2.  **Competition among units in terms of development:** In a federal state, there are competition among various units, resulting in some states developing much better than others.
3.  **It brings government nearer to the people:** This is a credit to decentralisation. Government is brought nearer to the people at the grassroots.
4.  **Absence of dictatorship:** The supremacy of the constitution and the application of the rule of law removes the tendency for a dictatorial government.
5.  **Fear of domination:** The fears of the minority are removed from the domination by the majority.
6.  **Wider consultation:** Decentralisation encourages wider consultation. No section of the country is neglected in the decision-making process.
7.  **Political unity:** Political unity is achieved because the system integrates many ethnic groups within the same system.
8.  **Matters of local interest:** With the division of functions made possible, matters of local interest can be allocated to the local areas.
9.  It increases efficiency of government.
10. It reduces the workload of central government, thereby increasing its efficiency.
11. It affords the leaders the opportunity for leadership training. For example, leaders graduate from regional to central government positions.
12. **Greater participation:** Decentralisation enhances greater participation of the people in government.
13. **Political stability:** The system encourages political stability because the various components are well represented in government.

**Demerits of Decentralisation**

1.  **Costly to operate:** This system is costly to operate, because many functions are created within the same system.
2.  **Delay in taking quick decisions:** The need for a wider consultation, in decision-making process, equally makes for a delay in taking quick decisions.

### **6.21 DELEGATED LEGISLATION**

**Definition:** Delegated legislation is defined as the act of transfering powers and functions through the Acts of Parliament to other organisations such as ministries, local governments, public corporations (DISCOs, Water Board), etc. Laws made by these bodies are referred to as bye-laws. Parliament finds it more convenient to lay down the general principles of laws and then leave the administrative and technical aspects to these other bodies, whose powers are delegated by the parliament. Delegated legislation is a special feature of a modern government.

**Types of Delegated Legislation**
1.  **Bye-laws:** These are laws made by local governments, public corporations, ministries. These powers are conferred on them through the Acts of Parliament.
2.  **Orders in Council:** In Britain, for example, these orders or proclamations are for the Queen or King to give orders on some matters having the backing of the law. These orders are mostly ratified by the Privy Council (highest Court of Appeal in the United Kingdom) which is a body that advises the Crown on political and governmental issues of the state.
3.  **Provisional orders:** A minister could be given the power to run an undertaking, e.g. a transport corporation, but at this stage, it is provisional or temporary until confirmed by parliament.
4.  **Special procedure orders:** The minister makes the order and presents it to the parliament. The order comes into force after 14 days, unless petitions of a general objection have been lodged against it.
5.  **Statutory instrument:** Ministerial regulation is governed by Statutory Instrument Acts. These instruments are mainly directed to rules applicable to the country. For example, no-smoking in public institutions (schools, health institutions, etc. as directed by the ministry of health).
6.  **Rules of professional bodies:** There are rules and ethics guiding the activities of every member of a professional body, e.g. NMA and NBA. These rules are constitutionally legal and must be adhered to.
7.  **Warrants:** Examples of these are search and bench warrants. A warrant is a legal document that is signed by a Judge and gives the Police authority to do something, e.g. a warrant to search or arrest someone.

**Importance or Merits of Delegated Legislation to Modern Governments**
1.  **Reduction of workload:** Delegated legislation has succeeded in reducing the pressure of work on parliament.
2.  **Useful for emergencies:** In case of an external attack, the executive can take quick decisions.
3.  **It saves time:** Delegated legislation saves parliament enough time, whose legislative machinery could break down if it were to enact all laws.
4.  **Technical languages:** It is useful where technical languages are involved in government policies.
5.  **Efficiency:** Delegated legislation makes for efficiency and precision.
6.  **Experiment:** It is useful where experiment is desired. Most local governments have achieved something realistic through this experiment.
7.  **Adjusting to changing situation:** With this development, modern governments can adjust to changing situations and easily take care of contingencies.

**Reasons Why Delegated Legislation is Often Criticised or Demerits of Delegated Legislation**
1.  **It violates the principle of the rule of law:** Delegated legislation violates the principle of the rule of law which lays emphasis on the freedom of citizens.
2.  **Lack of publicity:** The numerous byelaws, rules and regulations are not known to the common citizens because they are not well publicised.
3.  **It violates the principle of separation of powers:** Delegated legislation also violates the principle of separation of powers and the sovereignty of the legislature.
4.  **The executive:** The executive may tend to grow more powerful than the legislature.
5.  **Too many law-making bodies:** Delegated legislation involves too many law-making bodies. The power of the judiciary to review the activities of the legislature is made difficult.
6.  **Abuse of power:** This can manifest itself. The departments involved in this exercise can easily abuse such powers delegated to them.
7.  **It is undemocratic:** Most of the laws made by some of these bodies are draconian, and undemocratic and do not have the support of the people.
8.  **The executive could become dictatorial:** The executive arm seems to have too much powers at its disposal. It could make it become dictatorial.
9.  **It violates the principle of parliamentary supremacy:** This is because other bodies or organisations are equally involved in performing legislative functions.
10. **Legislative functions could be eroded:** Laws made by these bodies may have a negative effect on legislative functions of parliament.
11. **It may not be acceptable:** Most of the laws and rules enacted may not be widely accepted because enough consultation was not made before their formulation and implementation.
12. **Parliamentary control:** The laws made by some of these bodies and their activities may lack effective parliamentary control.

#### **6.22 CONTROL OF DELEGATED LEGISLATION**

There are various methods in which the exercise of delegated legislation is controlled and these methods are:
1.  **Parliamentary control:** The parliament has the power to control the bills of these various bodies before such bills become laws. It can equally reject laws made by these bodies. In fact, there are standing committees in parliament that examine most of the statutory instruments of these bodies laid before the parliament.
2.  **Judicial control:** The law courts exercise control overrules and regulations made by these organisations. This is to make sure that these rules are made according to the provisions of the constitution. Similarly, the judiciary can declare unconstitutional some of the laws made by these organisations.
3.  **Ministerial control:** Activities of public corporations are under the control of the minister. Most of the bye-laws, rules and regulations made always receive his attention. Also, the minister has the power to dissolve the board of directors of most of these corporations.
4.  **Auditing or financial control:** The finances of most public corporations are audited to enhance efficient financial management. The government may send a team of auditors to perform this function.
5.  **Public Opinion:** The opinions of the public towards most of these organisations could be negative or positive. For example, the opinions of the public towards electricity generating companies are negative. Therefore, with this negative impression of the public, government can respond positively through the restructuring of the entire corporation. Equally, people are encouraged to let their grievances or problems known to the appropriate bodies, e.g. OMBUSDMAN (Public complaints commission) or any other body with similar expression.
6.  **Petitions:** This is also a way of controlling delegated legislation, people can write petitions against an organisation on issues affecting them, e.g. corruption. Also, people are encouraged to write letters to some government agencies about events unfolding in some of these bodies or organisations.
7.  **Accountability of ministers:** Ministers are in most cases summoned in parliament to account for the rules, regulations and bye-laws made in their various ministries.
8.  **Finance:** Most of these bodies or organisations depend, to a large extent, on government for allocations to meet their running cost. Government may withhold allocation to any of these organisations, as a way of checking their activities.
9.  **The press:** The press can act as a control of delegated legislation through their criticisms over rules and regulations governing the activities of these organisations. Some of these rules are antagonistic to the rights of the citizens and the operation of the rule of law.
10. **Unnecessary duplication:** It will help to prevent unnecessary duplication or contradiction of laws, rules and regulations.
11. **Safeguard against obnoxious laws:** The control of delegated legislation will help to safeguard citizen’s liberties from obnoxious laws.
12. **Accountability:** It will make officials accountable for their actions.
13. **Autocracy:** It will help to prevent bodies with powers of delegated legislation from being autocratic.
14. **Usurpation of powers:** Control of delegated legislation will help to prevent undue usurpation of the powers of legislature.

SEPARATION OF POWERS**

**Definition:** It is defined as the separation or division of political powers and functions among the three arms of government—the executive, legislature and judiciary. Each body should be constituted and be involved only in the administration of that department. For example, the executive should be solely involved in policy making and implementation. Liberal writers believe that power is dangerous and argue that it is normally bad for men to enjoy an excessive amount of it. Lord Acton declared in one of his writings that ‘power corrupts, but absolute power corrupts absolutely’.

Montesquieu, in his book, *The Spirit of Laws*, argued that if the legislature and executive powers are in unity, there can be no liberty and freedom for the citizens of a country. He maintained further that if the same person enacts tyrannical laws, such laws will also be executed in a tyrannical manner. Bodin, the French writer, also maintained that, the Prince should not administer justice in person, but should leave such matters to independent judges. Similarly, it is argued that if the rules are made by one group of people, applied or executed by a third party, it should be possible to prevent a situation where too much power accumulates in one place.

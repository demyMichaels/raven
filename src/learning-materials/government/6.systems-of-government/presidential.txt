PRESIDENTIAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT**

Definition: Presidential system of government is defined as one in which the head of state of a country is also the head of government. It is a system in which all executive powers are vested in one person with the title of the executive president.

The constitution of a presidential system of government is supreme and has succeeded in depositing the offices of the head of state and government in the executive president. For example, in Nigeria’s Second Republic of 1979/1983, President Shehu Shagari was both the Head of State and Government of Nigeria, exercising executive powers within the system.

He was also the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and the police force. The 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria that ushered in the Third Republic also gave the same powers to President Olusegun Obasanjo.

The whole country is the president’s constituency and he is popularly elected by the electorate. To assist is a vice president to whom he can delegate some of his duties. The principle of separation of powers among the three organs of government: executive, legislature and judiciary, is strictly adhered to in this system. The United States of America is a good example of a country wholly committed to presidential system.

**Characteristics of Presidential System of
Government**

1. Head of state and government: The
executive president serves as both the
head of state and that of government in the
system.

2. Ceremonial and executive functions:
The president performs both ceremonial
and executive functions.

3. Popularly elected: The executive
president is popularly elected by the
electorate. The whole country is his
constituency.

4. Appointment of cabinet members: He
has the constitutional power to appoint
any member of his cabinet from within and
outside his own party.

5. Fixed term of office: The president is
elected for a fixed term of office. For
example, Nigeria’s Second Republic of
1979 to 1983, the president stayed in
office for four years, though it has a
maximum of two terms (eight years). The
1999 Constitution also provides for four
years with a maximum of two terms.

6. Individual responsibility: Ministers are
individually responsible to the president
who appointed them. He, therefore, has
direct control over them.

7. Dismissal: The president can also dismiss
members of his cabinet or even reshuffle
the entire cabinet.

8. Separation of powers: The three organs
of government: executive, legislature and
judiciary have separate functions.

9. Impeachment: The president or the
governors of states can be removed by the
parliament through the process called
impeachment if found guilty of gross
misconduct.

10. Opposition: The system does not accom-
modate opposition. In fact, it is not legalised
in the system.

11. Ministers not part of the legislature:
Ministers in this system can only be in the
cabinet and cannot form part of the legislature.

12. Bicameral legislature: The parliament
is bi-cameral, i.e. the Senate and the House
of Representatives. It cannot be dissolved
but can only stay for a fixed term.

13. Supremacy of the constitution: The
constitution in this system is supreme and,
as such, must be obeyed and respected by
all authorities and persons.

14. Checks and balances: This is very effective
among the three organs of government.

15. Judicial review: The supreme court has
the power to review some activities of the
executive and legislature and to declare
some unconstitutional actions null and void.

16. Rule of law: Rule of law is in operation in
this system.


**Advantages of the Presidential System of Government**

1. Best materials are given political appointments: The president has a free hand when appointing his ministers and other political appointees. Ministers could be chosen from outside his party and as such best materials are appointed.

2. Checks and balances: Checks and balances are very effective among the three organs of government.

3. Individual responsibility of ministers: A minister could be held responsible for poor performance and can be dismissed by the president. His dismissal will not affect other ministers because responsibilities are not collective as obtained in the cabinet system of government.

4. Popularly elected: The president is, popularly elected and as such, the party does not have control over him but can only advise. He is only responsible to the electorate.

5. Separation of powers: Powers are distinctly separated and this enhances effective performance of each of the organs.

6. Activities of the ministers: The president can effectively check the activities of the ministers because they are individually responsible to him.

7. Enough time: Ministers have enough time to attend to their duties because they only belong to the executive.

8. It is democratic: All institutions that make for democratic government are embedded in this system. For instance, electoral institutions, independence of the judiciary, etc. are always there.

9. Supremacy of the constitution: No individual can manipulate the constitution to suit his selfish desire. Only the parliament has the sole right of amending the constitution.

10. Fixed term of office: The President has a fixed term to stay in the office and there is no way he can transform himself into a life president.

11. Easy identification of weaknesses or failures: This is because powers are distinctly separated in this system, unlike in the parliamentary system where powers are fused. Any organ that does not perform can easily be identified.

12. No conflict situation: In parliamentary system, powers of the head of state are different from those of the head of government. But in presidential system, both offices are fused and exercised by the executive president. Therefore, the possibility of conflict in the exercise of functions will not arise.

**Disadvantages of Presidential System of Government**

1. Delay in the execution of programme: Separation of powers can cause delay in the execution of some government programmes. For example, the legislature can delay the approval of the budget or names of those nominated for ministerial, ambassadorial posts, etc.

2. Impeachment process may be difficult: The difficulty in the process of impeachment could make a president to stay and abuse his office and yet complete his term.

3. Problems may arise between the executive and the legislature: This can result when the ruling party is not maintaining the majority in the legislature.

4. Vetoing of bills: The president can misuse or even abuse the powers given to him to veto bills.

5. No security of tenure for ministers:
Ministers can be removed from office any time by the president. There is no security of tenure for them.

6. **Lobbying:** This is a common feature in the system, especially in the parliament and can lead to corrupt practices.

7. **Costly to operate:** There are too many duplications of functions both in the executive and the legislature. For example, there are many ministers and law makers in both the houses and this makes the system costly to operate.

**Checks on the Powers of the Executive President**

1. **Judicial review:** The power of the supreme court to declare unconstitutional or illegal some of the actions or activities of the president is a check on his powers.

2. **Impeachment:** The president can be impeached or removed from office by the parliament if he is found to violate the provisions of the constitution.

3. **Approval of appointments:** The parliament has the power to approve or reject names submitted to it by the president for appointment as ministers, ambassadors, etc.

4. **Passage of bills:** If the ruling party is not constituting a majority in the parliament, the passage of president’s bill will be difficult.

5. **Supremacy of the constitution:** The constitution defines the powers of the president and his tenure. This is a check on his powers.

**Checks on the Powers of the Executive in a Presidential System of Government**
The various forms of check on the executive are:

1. **Legislative Forms**
   (a) **Annual budget:** The National Assembly must approve the annual budget proposed by the executive.

Any responsible government must act according to the opinions of the people. Also, as members of international organisations, the executive must be ready to abide by the opinions expressed as well as rules governing these bodies, etc. These are checks on the executive.

(b) The use of pressure groups: The ability of pressure groups to influence government’s decisions politically, economically, socially, etc. is a check on the powers of the executive.

**3.5 FACTORS THAT LED TO THE INCREASING POPULARITY OF THE PRESIDENTIAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IN WESTAFRICA**

1. **Colonial legacy:** The parliamentary system, a colonial legacy from Britain on her former West African colonies could not guarantee desired political stability after independence.

2. **Traditional African political system:** The presidential system resembles the traditional African political system, as separating the offices of Heads of State and government is not only meaningless in Africa but also difficult to achieve.

3. **Quick decision-making:** The process of decision-making is quick and orderly because of the absence of opposition.

4. **Collective responsibility:** It eliminates the parliamentary collective responsibility, a requirement of all cabinets resigning because of one man’s mistake.

5. **Nation-building:** Looking at the mode of his election and his powers, the president is capable of instituting a strong executive that can promote a faster rate in the process of nation-building.

6. **Division of ceremonial and executive functions:** The friction and bickering that characterises the parliamentary system as a result of the division of ceremonial and executive functions is removed.

7. **Responsibility for certain function:** It is easier to identify who has responsibility for certain function and who is to blame for lapses or inaction.

8. **Novel system:** The need to adopt a novel system led to the presidential system of government.

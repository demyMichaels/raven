SOVEREIGNTY

**Meaning:** Sovereignty means the supreme power and authority of the state over the citizens. It is the power of the state (exercised by a body of persons known as sovereign) to make laws and enforce them with all the means of coercion it cares to employ, without any interference by other states. The idea of sovereignty originated from Jean Bodin (1530 - 1590), a French political thinker and philosopher.

**Principal Characteristics of Sovereignty**

The following are the characteristics of sovereignty:

1. **Indivisibility:** Sovereignty is supreme, final and with coercive power of the state over the people living within the state. Sovereignty cannot be divided, though government can delegate powers to certain agencies.

2. **Absoluteness:** The powers of a sovereign state cannot be restricted. There is no limitation to its legal powers within its area and it receives orders from none.

3. **Permanence:** As long as the state exists, sovereignty continues without interruption; it is a permanent attribute of the state which does not change.

4. **Independence of foreign control:** A sovereign state is independent of foreign control.

5. **Comprehensiveness:** The powers exercised by the government are wide and]
encompassing. These powers are binding on all.

Types of Sovereignty
The following are the different types of sovereignty:
1. Legalsovereignty: The body that makes laws and enforces same in the state is the legal sovereign. For example, parliament is the legal sovereign in Britain. The parliament also has the amending power of the constitution.
2. Political or popular sovereignty: It refers to that body which is supreme in a state, the will which is ultimately obeyed by the citizens of the state. The electorate constitute the political sovereign. The will of the electorate ultimately prevails because legal sovereignty, in the making of law, is bound to act according to their will.
3. Defacto sovereignty: It refers to the body or group of people who use force to make citizens obey their will, after overthrowing the legitimate sovereign of the state through invasion or revolution, e.g. the military in government.
4. De jure sovereignty: This type of sovereign rule is based on law and its application as opposed to physical exercise or use of force.
5. Internal sovereignty: This refers to supreme power the state has to make and enforce laws within its area of authority.
6. Externalsovereignty: The power of the state to exist and conduct its domestic affairs without external interference. The state also has the power to decide on how to relate with other nations of the world on an equal basis.


Location of Sovereignty in a State
Sovereignty could be located in any of the following institutions or groups in a state.

1. Location in a federal state:
 The constitution of a federal state is supreme and it recognises different authorities and with different powers and functions to exercise, for example, the central government and other subordinate units, like state and local governments. Therefore, sovereignty in a federal state is shared since powers are constitutionally shared too.

2. Location in a unitary state: Since most of the constitutions of a unitary state recognise only the central level of authority and give it all the powers, sovereignty therefore resides with the central government. For example, in Britain, the central government has supreme authority over other institutions created by it.

3. The electorate: The electorate have the ultimate power, through the election, to decide who will be their representatives in government. Therefore, political sovereignty resides with the electorate.

4. In a monarch: Britain is a good example where the location of sovereignty can be traced to the Queen in Parliament.
5. Location in a military regime: Military regimes are highly centralised. Nigeria is a good example where sovereignty resides in the central decision-making body of every military regime, for example, the Provisional Ruling Council which exercised both executive and legislative functions.

Limitations to the Sovereignty of a State
The following are some of the internal and external limitations to the sovereignty of a state


(A) INTERNAL LIMITATIONS
1. The constitution: 
The constitutions of]
most states are supreme. Constitution defines the powers exercised by the various levels of government. It therefore limits the powers of the government.

2. The electorate: 
They possess ultimate power in a state. Therefore, any government should be responsible to the people whose collective affairs it directs and controls.

3. Public opinion
: In democracies, governments are open and accommodating. They take into consideration, the opinion of the people when formulating policies. This is limitation to the exercise of their powers.

4. The Military: 
The military through forceful removal of democratic government is a limitation to the sovereignty of the state. The tradition mostly exhibited by the military is the suspension of the constitution of the state after taking over of power.

5. Customs and traditions: 
Customs and traditions of the people are mostly considered by the state before or when making policies and laws.

6. Religion and culture: 
Religion and culture play a very important role in the political affairs of a nation. When making policies and laws in the state, religion and culture of the people are mostly considered by the government.

7. Delegated legislation: 
In most modern democracies, delegated legislation is recognised. Powers are, therefore, delegated to other bodies to exercise, thereby working against the sovereignty of the parliament. This is a limitation to the sovereignty of the state.

8. Resources: 
Absence or lack of human and material resources can put on hold the exercise of the state authority.

9. Activities of pressure groups: 
Some categories of individuals and pressure groups in a state need to be contacted before laws are made and executed. The failure to observe this can make such pressure groups to influence the public to act otherwise.

10. Type of government in power: The exercise of sovereignty is best achieved in a unitary state than in a federal or confederal system of government.



(B) EXTERNAL LIMITATIONS

11. International organisations: 
States which belong to international organisations, e.g. the UN and regional or sub-regional groupings, e.g. A.U. and ECOWAS respectively must be ready to abide by any collective decisions taken by the organisations.

12. International laws and conventions: 
This is concerned with relationship among nations of the world. States that disobey international laws and conventions may face some sanctions. These sanctions are usually imposed by the Security Council, an organ of the United Nations.

13. Inter-dependence of states: 
Most less-developed countries of the world depend on the developed ones for aids of different dimensions. The donor country can influence both the domestic and external policies of the recipient country. This constitutes a limitation.

14. Dominance of powerful states: 
The big powers, e.g. USA, Russia, China, Britain and France, determine the course of events globally. This can negatively affect the sovereignty of most states.

15. Military agreements or pacts:
 Two or more countries can agree to co-operate militarily. For example, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) WARSAW  
PACT and ECOMOG, Cameroon and  
France also have military agreement.  

16. **External aids:** External sovereignty of states  
that are less developed or poor has been  
undermined by the economic, technical and  
military assistance of donor states.  


17. **International financial institutions:** 
The  
World Bank and IMF for instance, have  
succeeded in dictating to many countries  
on how to run their economies especially when  
such countries are asking for loans. In fact,  
many countries today are puppets of IMF.  

18. **Diplomatic immunity:** 
Diplomats  
representing their countries in other  
countries of the world have diplomatic  
immunity. Some of their actions can  
undermine the sovereignty of their host states.  

19. **External trade:**
 This could be in the form  
of exportation and importation of goods.  
Treaties governing this trade must be  
respected by each country.  

20. **Geographical location:** 
For example,  
landlocked countries, nearness to other  
states, etc. can limit the sovereignty of a state.

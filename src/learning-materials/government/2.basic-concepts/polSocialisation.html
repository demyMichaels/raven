POLITICAL SOCIALISATION 

Definition:
Political socialisation is defined as the process of acquiring political beliefs, values, attitude as well as citizenship training that shapes a citizen’s political behaviour. It is also the process of political learning from childhood to adulthood. It is a life-long developmental process.

Agents of Political Socialisation
The following are the agents of political socialisation:

1. Family unit: Transmission of knowledge about politics, authority and allocation of values probably starts at home. The child’s knowledge and experience of political activities start at family unit.
2. The peer group: The group one moves with helps to dictate or at least influence one’s political emotion.
3. Institutions of learning: Schools, colleges and other educational institutions provide an avenue for political talks, debates and discussions which are basic socialising mechanisms.
4. Social/Religious institutions: Members of social or religious institutions like social clubs, religious centres, associations, etc. do engage in political arguments and discussions by which members become politically socialised.
5. The mass media: Radio, TV, newspapers, etc. disseminate a lot of political news and also analyse political issues, thereby socialising listeners, readers and viewers politically.
6. Political parties: They educate their members and other people through their manifestoes, campaigns, rallies, etc., thereby stimulating people’s political awareness.
7. Pressure groups: Pressure groups equally educate their members and even the public through conferences, seminars, etc., especially in the areas of political and civic rights.

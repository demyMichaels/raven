**13.6 TYPES OF VOTING**
Direct elections could be by public voting or secret balloting. Any of the voting methods may be used in electing political leaders in a country.

**Secret balloting:** Voters cast their votes secretly. The voter alone makes the decision in the voting exercise. In this election, ballot papers inscribing the names of the parties and symbols, ballot box, envelope (may or may not be used), ink pad, etc. are some of the materials needed for secret voting. Also, a presiding officer, polling clerk and polling orderly are the electoral officials in charge of a polling station. There are also security agents (the police) and party agents.

**Merits of Secret Balloting**
1. **It is democratic:** Secret voting preserves the rights of the voter. He makes the decision alone without coercion.

4. **Costly to operate:** The cost involved in the production of the materials needed for the election may be so high.

**Public Voting:** It is the type of voting that is done openly or publicly. The voters will have to line up according to their political parties and the counting of the voters is done by the presiding officer before everybody present. The results are declared on the spot. Nigeria has tried this system in the past.

6. **It can induce violence:** Those not satisfied with the outcome of the result may go on rampage and destruction of lives and property could result from the process.
7. **Manipulation of the results:** Electoral officials could still manipulate the results of the election, by declaration of false figures.

**13.7 INDIRECT ELECTION**
In this system, the electorate (voters) elect the members of parliament (law-makers) and the law-makers will have to vote on behalf of the people to elect the president, i.e. the head of state of the country.
This system was used in the first Republic to elect the first President of Nigeria – 1963-66. Nnamdi Azikiwe was the first President of Nigeria.
However, this system is mostly operational in a parliamentary system of government. Great Britain is a good example.

11. **Corrupt electoral officials:** There is the possibility of the electoral officials getting involved in some corrupt practices during the process of election.

**13.8 ELECTORAL COLLEGE**
**Meaning:** This is a group or body of elected representatives who in turn come together to elect people into political offices.
It is also a group of people who are chosen to represent the members of a political party in the election of a leader. The Americans elect their President through Electoral College.

12.2 ELECTORAL SYSTEM
Definition: An electoral system may be defined as a process or method through which the people of a given country elect their representatives into different political offices or positions in government. It also includes the conditions and processes for the nomination of candidates for elective posts including procedure and rules of election.

In Nigeria, for example, an electoral commission with different designations, is appointed to organise and conduct all elections in the country. For example, Federal Electoral Commission (FEDECO) conducted 1979 to 1983 Second Republic elections. National Electoral Commission (NEC) conducted the 1993 aborted Third Republic elections. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) conducted the 1999 Fourth Republic elections. INEC also conducted 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015 and 2019 general elections of the Fourth Republic.

12.3 CHARACTERISTICS OF AN ELECTORAL SYSTEM

publicandwithimmediatereleaseofresults.
10. Nomination of candidates by political parties: This should be done in a way that it will appeal to the generality of the people.
11. Secret ballot: This method of election should be adopted.
12. Political education: The people should be properlyeducated about theirpolitical rights, elections and aboutthe political system.
13. Materials for election: Materials for election, e.g. ballotboxes, ballotpapers, ink pad, polling booths, etc., are provided.
12.4 TYPES OFELECTORALSYSTEM (a) Single-member constituency and single vote: This system is usually referred to as “first past the post” or simple majority system. A candidate has the highest number of votes cast to win the election, Britain, USA, Canada, etc. are examples of this system.
(b) Single member and second ballot: Failure of any candidate to receive absolute majority at the first ballot, a second one is held with the weaker candidates either choosing or being required to retire, e.g. France.
(c) Single member with preferential vote: This system allows the electorate to place the candidate in order of preference. The votes of the weaker candidates being distributed to the stronger ones, according to second, third, etc.
(d) Proportional representation: The essence of proportional representation is to allocate seats in proportion to the votes cast in multi-member constituencies. It is a method used to elect representatives into the legislature. The total number of votes which a party or group scores is calculated in proportion to the total number of votes cast. There are two types of proportional representation. These are:
(i) The list system: Theelectoratevotesforallist of candidates presented by a political party and each party wins the number of seats in that constituency according to the votes cast for that partylist.
(ii) Single transferable vote: All the candidates in multi-member constituencies are marked in order of preference by the voters. After counting the votes, an electoral quota is established, i.e. the minimum number of votes needed by a candidate to win one of the seats, the surplus votes are redistributed to other candidates according to the voters order ofpreference. The weakest candidates are then eliminated and their votes are redistributed according to the voters second, third, etc. preferences.

Merits of Proportional Representation
1. Proportional representation: The proper consideration ofeach vote cast, making the notion ‘one man, one vote, one value’ a reality.
2. It is democratic: The system makes for a true democracy. The people are involved in the decision-making process.
3. Equal weights: Proportional representation permits all seats to be given equal weights.
4. It widens voters’ choice: The choices of the voters are widened, especially in a multi-member constituency.
5. Proportional representation: This reflects the views of all areas, groups and persuasions.
6. It is a truly representative government: The system ensures a truly representative government.
7. It permits free expression: Proportional representation also permits free expression ofindividual opinion.

Demerits of Proportional Representation
1. Weak government: Since each state or party is represented according to its population, a weak government may be produced.

2. **False assumption:** Proportional representation is based on false assumption.

3. **Complex electoral system:** It is difficult and seen as a complex electoral system.

4. **Emergence of splinter groups:** Many splinter groups may emerge in the system.

5. **Reduction of party discipline:** This is because representatives are representing the interests of the electorate. So, in most cases, they tend to disregard party directives on issues about the electorate. Party discipline is highly desirable to give order to government.

(e) **Plurality System:** This system is also referred to as ‘first past the post’ or simple majority system. In this system, the candidate who scores the highest number of votes is deemed elected. It is based on a single-member constituency. A candidate has to obtain a simple majority (plurality) of votes to be elected. He need not have to win an absolute majority of all the votes cast in the election. For example, there are four candidates with the following scores from 50,000 voters.

| Candidate | A --- | 14,000 |
|---|---|---|
|    | B --- | 13,000 |
|    | C --- | 12,000 |
|    | D --- | 11,000 |

Candidate A is declared elected because he has the plurality of votes.

**Advantages of Plurality System**

1. **Simple voting:** The simple voting procedure enables a voter to vote directly for or against a particular candidate or party or policy.

2. **The procedure of voting:** This procedure is so simple that it appeals to both the literate and the illiterate electorate.

3. **It produces a winner:** The system produces a winner after the first ballot.

4. **It is economical:** It saves money, time and energy. It also eliminates the need for a run-off election.

5. **Political stability:** It encourages political stability through the elimination of smaller political parties.

6. **It encourages the strengthening of party organisation:** This is because, it emphasises competition among political parties rather than candidates.

7. **The use of few parties:** It prevents the existence of many parties and removes the tendency for a coalition government.

**Disadvantages of Plurality System**

1. **Rigging:** There is the possibility of rigging the election in this system.

2. **Inefficient and unpopular politicians:** They may win the elections, hiding under the popularity of the party.

3. **No reflection of the wishes of the majority:** The system does not produce result that reflects the wishes of the majority.

4. **Unpopular government:** The system may enthronce a government that is not popular.

5. **Little chance of winning:** Smaller parties have a little chance of winning elections in a simple majority system.

6. **No clear reflection of party’s strength:** The system does not reflect clearly the strength of the political parties.

7. **Undemocratic in nature:** It is undemocratic because the combined votes of losers may exceed those of the winner.

8. **Ethnicity:** Ethnic factor may play out in this system. This is because it may negatively affect or influence voting the right candidate in the election.

(f) **Second Ballot System:** This system involves two ballots. At the first instance, the successful candidate is required to obtain an absolute majority of the votes cast (that is, 50 per cent plus one). If this was not obtained by any of the


[file content end]

[file content begin]
candidates, a second ballot is required, and those having unacceptably low result would be eliminated. The winning candidate is then required to obtain a simple majority.

(g) The Alternative System: In this system, each voter is given the permission to indicate his choice of candidates in order of preference – first, second and third. If there is no absolute majority, the candidate who scores least can be dropped and his vote distributed to other candidates according to the second preference of the voter. Below is a hypothetical example.

| Party | First Result | Second Preference | Second Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| A    | 50,000    | 2000    | 52,000    |
| B    | 46,000    | 8000    | 54,000    |
| C    | 10,000    | ---    | ---    |

Note: Votes for C distributed between A and B as second preferences.

(h) Absolute Majority System: In the absolute majority system of voting, a candidate must score more than half of the votes cast before he can be declared the winner.

Advantages of Absolute Majority System

1. It is a reflection of the wishes of the people: It reflects the wishes of the majority. It is the popular choice of the people.
2. No room for unpopular candidate: The system does not allow for an unpopular candidate to get elected easily.
3. It produces credible candidates: It produces credible candidates, judging from the outcome of the election.

Disadvantages of Absolute Majority System

1. It is expensive and time-consuming: If no candidate won the election in the first ballot, another voting would be required and could therefore be expensive and time-consuming.
2. Rigging of results: The system may lead to rigging of election results in order to secure the required number of votes.
3. Illiteracy: Absolute majority system cannot work very well where most of the voters are illiterate.
4. Administrative bottlenecks: It is complicated as it involves a lot of calculations and administrative bottlenecks.
5. Unnecessary delay: The result of the election is unnecessarily delayed if a winner could not emerge after the first balloting.
6. Voters’ apathy: Voters whose candidates are dropped in the first ballot may not wish to participate in the second ballot, leading to voters’ apathy.
7. The system tends to weaken other smaller political parties.
8. Tension and violence: An absolute majority system can lead to political tension and violence.

(i) The Repeated Ballot: This is an electoral system in which voters vote continuously with intervals for discussions and negotiations until a winner emerges. The system is used in nominating the American Presidential Candidate at the party’s convention/primary. The system is also applicable when a new Pope is to be elected by a body of cardinals.

12.5 ELECTORAL CONSTITUENCY Definition: An electoral constituency is simply an electoral district or an area from which one or more members or representatives are elected into political offices. The division of a country into constituencies is referred to as delimitation and it makes for equitability in the allocation of parliamentary seats.




The following are the factors influencing constituency delimitation.

12.6 FACTORS INFLUENCING THE DELIMITATION OF CONSTITUENCIES

1. Administrative convenience: The need to consider convenience has often led to the merging of some local areas that are near to one another.
2. Population: A high density area may press for a separate constituency even when the area is not that large.
3. Minority interest: Some areas have been carved out as a constituency, not for their large areas or population, but most importantly to satisfy the interest of minorities.
4. Geographical factors: This relates to the topography of the area. A constituency area must be considered in relation to its accessibility.
5. Historical and cultural background: People with same historical background and of course culture should be grouped together.
6. Number of seats available: The number of seats available and to be allocated to each constituency can influence delimitation.

12.7 TYPES OF CONSTITUENCIES
1. Single-member constituency or district system: It requires the election of only one member into the legislature. This system is done in every election. Every voter is only entitled to one vote. Nigeria adopts this method.

Merits of Single-member Constituency
(i) Areas which return members to the legislature: The constituency must be small enough to enable candidates to be known in a simple and genuine way.
(ii) Close touch with his constituency: This system enables the elected member to keep in close touch with his constituency.
(iii) Simple and economical: This system is simple and economical, especially for the candidates.
(iv) It is more democratic: This is because the poor candidate is not at a disadvantage as he would be in a large constituency.
(v) Local talent: It is more likely to encourage local talents than the larger multi-member constituency. This is because men of moderation will feel more confident where the constituency is small and their local influence counts.
(vi) Stable majority: The system tends to provide a more stable majority in a legislature than the multi-membersystem.
(vii) Active interest in the political process: It encourages people in the community to take active interest in the political process.
(viii) Community support: A single-member constituency encourages candidates who are community-based.
(ix) Promotion of political stability: The system makes it easy for a party or candidate to win a majority in legislature and thus maintain political stability.
(x) Accountability: The constituencies are small and therefore it makes accountability to be enforced.

Demerits of Single-member Constituency
(i) Representation of local interests: It leads to the choice of men who regard themselves as representatives of local interests rather than of the country as a whole.
(ii) Gerrymandering: It increases powerfully the temptation of legislative majorities



form of electoral malpractice or the other in order to have their people in the corridors of power. The reason is that most of them want to be relevant in the political dispensation of the country.

4. **Extravagant spending:** Lavish and unnecessary spending of public money by our politicians is one of the causes of electoral malpractices in Nigeria.

5. **Over-ambition of politicians:** They are over-ambitious and would want to be in office at all cost. Many of them are not popular in their constituencies and so, the only way out is to rig elections, manipulate and falsify electoral figures.

6. **Frustration:** Some politicians, who have lost at the polls many times, may engage in different unlawful means to win the election.

7. **Hidden foreign influence:** Some foreign countries are secretly involved in sponsoring some candidates or political parties in other countries. They strictly monitor every electoral activity in order to make sure that they favour their candidates or political parties. This may result because they want to protect the economic advantages they are enjoying in the affected country.

**Forms of Electoral Malpractices**

1. **The use of fake ballot papers:** Some politicians seeking power at all cost will go as far as printing fake ballot papers. At times, they conspire with the electoral officers to achieve this.

2. **Underage voting:** The age of voting in Nigeria is 18 years and above. In some cases, children below this age have been allowed to vote in elections, thereby violating electoral laws.

3. **Bribery:** This is the act of offering money or gifts in order to gain the votes of the people. This dirty act has almost become part of the Nigerian system. Some notable politicians are deeply involved in this, in order to win elections and be in government.

4. **Artificial scarcity of electoral materials:** Some electoral officials in connivance with some politicians could create artificial scarcity of electoral materials in the areas they suspect their opponents are likely to be more popular than they are.

5. **Use of thugs and intimidation:** In Nigeria, some influential politicians use thugs to intimidate their political opponents. This is common on the day of election or during campaign tours of the political parties. In some cases, these thugs snatch ballot boxes and even cause confusion at polling centres.

6. **Fake manifestoes:** Manifestoes are programmes of a political party, defining what they intend to do for the people, when they win the election.

In an attempt to get more votes during elections, political parties make unattainable promises to deceive the people. Such promises are fake and nothing but deceit.

7. **Stealing of electoral materials:** This could be done in many ways. They may decide to steal voters cards and to keep them until election days, creating the opportunity for their supporters to vote twice. They equally decide to steal ballot papers, ink pad and ballot boxes.

8. **Rigging of election results:** This could be done by electoral officers with the cooperation of party agents, security agents and some unscrupulous politicians to favour a particular candidate that might have bribed them. This is mainly to tamper with election results or falsify the figures.

Consequences of Electoral Malpractices
1. **Apathy:** Electoral malpractices may cause citizens to lose interest in political activities. Many of these acts of electoral malpractices have been ongoing and no corrective or punitive measures have been taken, resulting in many of the citizens deciding to keep away from politics.
2. **Corrupt leadership:** Leaders that emerge through electoral malpractices will definitely be leaders of corruptive disposition. They assume power through electoral malpractices and then govern the people the way it pleases them. Economic and financial mismanagement could result from this.
3. **Autocratic leadership:** Electoral malpractices may produce autocratic leadership. They do not do the wish of the people but rather force their programmes on the people.
4. **Loss of lives and property:** Lives and property of some notable politicians and innocent citizens have been wasted due to imposition of wrong candidates on the people, for example, the “operation wetic” period in the old Western Region.

5. **Military interventions:** Electoral malpractices can also lead to military intervention. They often come into power on the pretext of restoring peace and order in the country.
6. **International sanctions:** Nations can stand against leaders that came to power through electoral malpractices. They may want to frustrate them out of office by imposition of sanctions.

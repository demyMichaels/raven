10.1 PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES

At the end of this chapter, students should be able to:
(1) Define pressure groups.
(2) Identify types of pressure groups.

(4) Analyse their modes of action.
(5) Indicate the functions of pressure groups.

10.2 PRESSURE GROUP
Definition: Pressure group is defined as organised groups, which influence government decisions socially or economically, without necessarily entering into election activities for the control of government. In doing this, they influence the executive, legislature and other officials of government to achieve their immediate aims. However, some have argued that pressure groups are part of the political process and that they attempt to reinforce or change the direction of government policy, but do not wish, as it were, to be in government.

10.3 TYPES OF PRESSURE GROUPS
1. Economic pressure groups: These are mostly manufacturers’ associations like Chamber of Commerce, Cocoa Farmers Union, Cotton Producers Union, etc. They mount pressure on and at the same time influence the government whenever they have problems on issues affecting their members.
2. Professional pressure groups: They are organised professional associations like the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), etc. They can go on strike to press home their demands for an improved better condition of their members.
3. Educational pressure groups: These groups have to do with lecturers in colleges and higher institutions of learning, students and the non-academic staff of these institutions.

These groups mount pressure on government for better conditions of service and for the qualitative funding of the education sector; they sometimes go on strikes to press home their demands.
4. Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC): All the trade unions in Nigeria are under this body. It is the parent body that officially represents the interests of the workers with the government. There are state chapters of NLC.

5. **Promotional interest groups:** This group is out to champion the cause for an improved condition of the people’s welfare. This action may not necessarily benefit the members, but the less privileged in the society. For example, the Nigerian Bar Association gives free legal services to the less privileged in the society.

6. **Social pressure groups:** They are generally out to promote the general welfare of their members. Some of these groups are Boys Scout, Girls Guide, Rotary Club, Old Boys Association, etc.

7. **Religious pressure groups:** These include Christians, Moslems, Traditionalists, etc. Most issues affecting them have been resolved through lobbying of the executive and the parliament.

10.4 FUNCTIONS/IMPORTANCE OF PRESSURE GROUPS

1. **Offering useful suggestions:** They offer useful suggestions and advise governments at local, state and national levels.

2. **Promotion of economic stability:** This is made possible through the chamber of commerce.

7. **Provision of specialised information:** Pressure groups provide specialised and expert information to the government.

8. **Promoting members’ interests:** This is done through the protection of such interests.

9. **Provision of manpower bank:** They provide manpower bank from which government can draw experts to serve in the government. For example, judges can only be appointed from within the Bar Association.

exhausted without result. It is a condition issued by pressure groups to either the government or employer and failure may attract unhealthy development.

6. **Association with international unions:** They join international groups as a way of attracting international sympathy. For example, the Nigeria Labour Congress is a member of the Organisation of African Trade Union Unity (OATUU).

7. **Pressure mounted on the executive:** The groups mount pressure on the executive, not to sign into law, bills that are seen as unhealthy. Such bills may not produce something good for them or for the public.

8. **Working alliance with political party:** This is done in order to have their programmes become a major concern to the party, if election results in their favour. Most pressure groups give support to the party in order to win the election indirectly.

9. **Demonstrations:** Demonstration could be peaceful or violent. Pressure groups adopt these methods to mobilise support from members of the public.

10. **Consultation:** Most of the policies made by government are done based on consultations with some pressure groups.

11. **Work-to-rule:** No extra work is done apart from the normal working period.

12. **Debates and symposia/workshops:** These are organised to educate the people on their work and also their stand on some issues.

13. **Propaganda/Letters to the press:** Pressure groups write letters to the press to educate the public and to show their stand on important policies.

14. **Special publications:** This is done either in the press, handbills or booklets to publicise their action.

15. **Presentation of gifts:** In West Africa, a common feature of pressure groups is to present gifts (gratifications) to policy makers to influence their decisions on certain issues.

10. **DANGERS POSED BY THE ACTIVITIES OF PRESSURE GROUPS**

1. **Political instability:** This can result especially where the activities of pressure groups lead to the fall of government in power.

2. **Social disorder:** The activities of pressure groups may be accompanied by social disorder, e.g. riot, violent demonstrations, etc.

3. **The majority may go unrepresented:** Pressure groups may be taken to represent more general opinions or people which may not be so. Therefore, the majority of the general public may go unrepresented where they have interest.

4. **Misrepresentation:** There could be misrepresentation of public opinion by a vocal few to the government.

5. **Misinformation of the general public:** Pressure groups may disseminate wrong information through mass propaganda, thereby misinforming the general public.

6. **Lobbying:** Pressure groups may corrupt public officials by engaging in lobbying.

7. **Strike action:** It is two-edged. The company suffers a downturn; also the legitimate support of the people.

8. **Negative effect on economy:** The country’s economy is affected by industrial actions.

They are self-centred; Pressure groups are self-centred. They are mostly vocal about issues affecting their members only.

10. Supporting a political party: The support given to a political party by pressure groups may produce a government that does not have the masses at heart.

10.8 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN POLITICAL PARTIES AND PRESSURE GROUPS

| Political Parties    | Pressure Groups    |
|---|---|
| To contest elections and control the government.    | To influence government policies and pursue the interests of the members.    |
| Political parties are organised to reach everybody in the society, not self-seeking.    | Pressure groups are basically self-seeking, not organised to reach everybody in the society.    |
| Political parties tend to accommodate virtually different interests in the society in terms of membership.    | Pressure groups do not accommodate different groups in the society.    |
| Political parties organise themselves into rallies, debates, lectures, seminars, etc. capable of projecting their ideologies in order to win more followership.    | When they have successfully influenced the government, with their aims achieved, they cease to exist.    |
| Political parties express opinions on several issues, e.g. education, health, agriculture and housing.    | Pressure groups are only concerned with matters affecting their members e.g. salaries, allowances and loans.    |
| Political parties pursue goals and, interests that will improve the lifestyle of the people in the society.    | Pressure groups pursue interests and goals that will improve the lifestyle of their members only.    |
| Candidates from political parties are to contest elections with the aim of being in government and ruling the people.    | Candidates contest elections for the leadership of their groups or unions and not for the people.    |

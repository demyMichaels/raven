(2) Discuss their structure of government.
(3) Explain the roles of the components of their respective structures.

19.2 HAUSA / FULANI POLITICAL SYSTEM
Historical background: The Fulani took over the political leadership of the Habe (Hausa) states in the early 19th century. The Jihad that preceded this occupation was seen as a religious one as well as political.

Usman dan Fodio led the Fulani Jihad and took over the political leadership of the Hausa and established the Sokoto caliphate with an outstanding centralised political system of government. He introduced a new system of selecting and appointing rulers described as Emirs to rule the caliphate. Each of the Emirs owed allegiance to dan Fodio and his two representatives at Gwandu and Sokoto.

19.3 POLITICAL ADMINISTRATION
1. The Emirate: The caliphate was divided into emirates and each was headed by an Emir who had the responsibility of making laws, enforcing them and maintaining peace and order in his emirate. He was expected to administer the emirate in accordance with the provisions of the Islamic and sharia laws. In fact, he was believed to have the divine right to rule. However, each emir was assisted in the administration of the emirate by a number of advisers. These were:
  1. The Waziri - He was the head of all the officials.
  2. The Galadima - He was incharge of the capital.
  3. The Madaki (Madawaki) - He was the commander of the army.
  4. Dogari - He was the head of the police.
  5. Maaji - He was incharge of treasury.
  6. Sarkin Ruwa - The river fishing official.
  7. Sarkin Fada - The head of the palace workers.
  8. Sarkin Pawa - The head of all butchers.

Note: Waziri was a very senior adviser and administrator. He was the prime minister.
2. Supreme headquarters: Sokoto and Gwandu were the seats of the Emirs. The Emir of Gwandu controlled the western empire while the Emir of Sokoto controlled the eastern empire. They appointed Emirs in each of the emirates under their jurisdiction.
3. District administration: Each emirate was divided into districts for administrative convenience. An official known as Hakimi was usually appointed by the Emir to administer the district.
4. Village heads: Village heads were appointed by Hakimi to help in the collection of taxes, e.g. cattle tax (Jangali) and maintenance of law and order in the villages.
5. Legislative functions: Islamic laws were the supreme laws of the emirate. The emir

232


had the capacity of making laws on matters which were not covered by Islamic laws.

(ii) Payment of tributes to sustain administration: There were rates paid by the people for land, property and cattle.
(iii) The size of the Emirate system was large: The emirate occupied a large expanse of land with many populations.
(iv) Stratification: The Hausa/ Fulani society was segmented into upper, middle and lower classes, and the Talakawas.
(v) Army: Every emirate kept a standing army under the control of Madawaki.
(vi) The judiciary: The emirate judicial system was based on the sharia laws headed by Alkali and the Emir’s court was the highest court.
(vii) Rulership was for life.
(viii) Succession to the throne was hereditary.
(ix) The political system was based on theocracy e.g. Islamic religion.
(x) Emirs were empowered to make laws where Islamic laws were silent.
(xi) Emirs were empowered to pronounce death sentence on defaulters.
(xii) There was regularised system of taxation in operation.
(xiii) Executive, Legislative and Judicial powers were concentrated on the Emir.

7. **Executive functions:** The emir was authoritarian and had absolute powers, even though he had a body of advisers, yet he could ignore or accept their advise.
7. **Judicial functions:** The judicial administration was based on Sharia laws. These laws were administered by Alkali judges. At times, minor cases might be passed to the village heads to be settled by them. Criminal and land cases were usually referred to the Emirs because Sharia laws dealt mainly with civil cases.
8. **Centralised administration:** The emirate system was a highly centralised one, with the emirs possessing almost all the powers. The Emir was an authoritarian ruler.

**Features of the Hausa/Fulani Pre-Colonial Political System in Nigeria**
(i). Centralisation of authority: Hierarchy in governance. The Emir was the head of government. He was assisted by appointed chiefs, e.g. Madawaki, Galadima and Waziri.

19.5 IGBO POLITICAL SYSTEM
The Igbo political system may be seen as a fragmented political system. Many institutions were in place and political authority was shared among them. For example, the Ofo title holders (council of elders), Ozo title holders and age grades were all involved in the power sharing exercise. No wonder then that, the term “Acephalous”, was ascribed or used to describe the political organisation of the Igbo political system. There was the absence of centralisation of power and authority in Igbo political system as it was more of the people’s direct participation in their government (direct democracy).

19.6 THE STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION OF IGBO POLITICAL SYSTEM

1. Village administration: The Igbo political system was based on the village as a political unit. A village is seen as inhabited by a group of related families. Each family head held the Ofo title and all of them, put together, formed the council of elders. The council governed the village. At the village meetings, every adult was expected to participate. Among the Ofo title holders, one of them was recognised as the most senior to others. He was referred to as the okyara and had the right to preside over the council of elders meetings, where issues affecting the people were discussed and implemented.

2. The age grade: These were young men that belonged to the same age group, and they performed the following functions:
(i) Administration: They were involved in the administration of the village.
(ii) Performance of public duties: They were involved in the performance of public duties such as clearing of paths, construction of roads, markets, etc.
(iii) Defence of the village: They equally served as the potential army for the defence of the village against external enemy.
(iv) Maintenance of law and order: They acted as the police force, for the maintenance of law and order.
(v) Implementation of policies: They also helped in the implementation of policies made by the Council of elders.
(vi) Abuse of powers: The age grades assisted in checking abuse of powers by the paramount rulers and council of elders.
(vii) Ceremonial and cultural functions: These functions were performed by the age

234


grades during important ceremonies in the community. In this system, there was the absence of formal political institutions like the executive, legislative or judicial arms.

3. The executive: The affairs of the village were discussed from time to time by family heads (council of elders). Every adult had the power to contribute.

4. The legislature: The villagers made laws themselves and even the age-grades could enact a law which the elders would accept.

5. The judiciary: In this area, family heads settled disputes between families. Serious cases were referred to the council of elders presided over by the Okpara and penalties were metted out to those who committed serious offences like murder, stealing, etc.

6. The Ozo title holders: Some wealthy and influential mentook this title which was very expensive. This title made the holder to be recognised in the society and could then preside over meetings on issues affecting the community with elders.

7. Provision of shrines: Shrines were provided and were seen as having political significance in providing bonds of unity and common ties.

8. Leadership: Succession to leadership positions was not hereditary in [gbo] political system.

9. Type of political system: The political system was more of a Republican. Decisions were reached by consensus. Different institutions played different but important roles in the administration and powers were shared by them.

Features of the Igbo Traditional Traditional Societies

1. Religious and judicial powers: The village priest/diviner wielded a great deal of religious and judicial powers.

2. Leadership: Succession to leadership and to prominence was based on personal achievements.

3. Bonds and unity: Deities are of political significance in providing bonds of unity.

4. Market square: It served as the village chambers.

5. Socio-political group: The women (Umuada) composed of the first daughter of each family, constituted a socio-political group.

6. Banishment: Banishment from the village and escort of such people into the evil forest was the maximum judicial punishment.

7. New Yam Festival: This was religiously marked, honoured and celebrated annually.

8. Decentralised administration: Different authorities, groups and institutions took part in the administration.

9. Village administration: The village was the highest unit of administration.

10. Village assembly: There existed a village assembly, known as Oha-na-eze/Ummuna.

11. Position of age-grades: They were young men of the same age group, involved in different activities, for example:
(i) Defence of the village
(ii) Maintenance of law and order
(iii) Implementation of policies, etc.

12. Family heads: They played important roles in the administration of the village.

13. Title holders (Ozo title): They played significant roles in the traditional political system.

1. Political Head: The Alaafin was seen as the political head of the empire. He was chosen by the Oyomesi (seven hereditary kingmakers of the empire). It was claimed that he could only appear three times a year in public and that was only during some historic festivals. The administration of the empire involved the Alaafin, assisted by the Aremo, the Bashorun, Oyomesi and others. The Bashorun (Prime Minister) and the Oyomesi played a very key role in the administration.

4. Provincial governors: (Baale or Oba) Each province was administered by Ajele or Oba. They guaranteed the payment of tributes and paying of homage to Oyo. There was the claim that these rulers had the power to threaten any hardened Alaafin or chief by invoking the god of thunder and lightning through the cult of Sango, to a deified Alaafin. It was alleged too that Sango was the god of thunder and lightning.

5. The army: Are-ona-kakanfo was the head of the army. Oyo had, for long, maintained a strong army and was involved in different wars. It was claimed that if the army suffered any defeat, the Kakanfo should commit suicide. However, the empire might experience a disobedient Kakanfo who would refuse to take directives from the Alaafin. For example, Kakanfo Afonja rebelled in Ilorin, and decided to use the army to score some political points. He was both the army commander and ruler of Ilorin. He later formed an alliance with the Fulani and declared his independence of the Alaafin.

6. The Ogboni society: This society possessed judicial powers and was involved also in policymaking. The maintenance and preservation of the cultural values of the people were also delegated to them. The Ogboni society was a secret society that influenced events in the society.

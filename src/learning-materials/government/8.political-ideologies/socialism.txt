SOCIALISM
Definition: Socialism can be defined as a social, political and economic system in which the state owns and controls the means of production, exchange and distribution of goods and services. The main aim of socialism is to ensure equal distribution of the nation’s wealth. The state, acting on behalf of the people, is seen as impartial]
and can adequately control all productive and
distributive activities in the state. This theory
originated as a protest against the evils of
capitalism. Karl Marx, a German (1818-1883),
propounded this theory.

Russia was the first country to embrace socialism.
Other countries that at one time or the other
practised this system include: China, Romania,
Poland, etc. In Africa, Tanzania, Ethiopia, etc.
also practised socialism.

            <h2>8.2 POLITICAL PARTY</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A political party is defined as an organised group of citizens, who act together as a political unit, having distinctive aims and objectives involving political questions in the state and acting together and seeking to obtain control of government.</p>
            
            <p>Secondly, it is also defined as an association of like-minded persons who organise themselves into a political group for the purpose of controlling political power and the administrative machinery of a state.</p>
            
            <p>Joseph Schumpeter, in his writing, observed that the first and foremost aim of each political party is to prevail over others in order to get into power or to stay in it.</p>
            
            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> It is the goal of attaining political power that distinguishes political parties from other groups in the political system, e.g. pressure group.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>In Nigeria's First Republic (1963-66), NPC, NCNC and AG were the prominent political parties that contested elections. However, there were a few other minor political parties.</p>

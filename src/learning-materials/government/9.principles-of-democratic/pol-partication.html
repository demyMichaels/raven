1.  **Lack of trust in the government:** If previous governments have been failing in their promises, the people may lose confidence and trust in such governments and the subsequent ones.
2.  **Fear of intimidation:** This may deny the individual the opportunity to express his opinion freely and this may affect his political participation.
3.  **Apathy or lack of interest:** Apathy could create a barrier between an individual and politics. The individual sees politics as not relevant and not worth going into.
4.  **Ignorance or illiteracy:** The effect of this is that the individual may not see the need to participate in politics. He sees politics as a birthright of the educated class only.
5.  **Frequent removal of elected governments:** This involves military intervention in politics, by frequent removal of elected civilian governments. This again can work against political participation.
6.  **Poverty:** Politics, they say, is money and money is politics. Poverty may deny an individual the golden opportunity of participating in the decision-making process of his country.

**35. INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION 2: THE COMMONWEALTH/THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS**

**35.1 PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES**
At the end of this chapter, students should be able to:
(1) List five international organisations.
(2) Explain the origin of these organisations.
(3) Discuss their aims and objectives.
(4) Discuss the achievements of each organisation.

**35.2 THE COMMONWEALTH**
**Definition:** The Commonwealth is defined as a free association of the former territories or colonies of the British Empire. These are territories that were colonised by Britain worldwide and later granted independence.

**35.3 THE ORIGIN OF THE COMMONWEALTH**
i. The origin of The Commonwealth could be traced to 1907 when representatives of governments of the five countries, Austria, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and South Africa met for the first time.
ii. The Association was formerly known as the British Commonwealth of Nations.
iii. The modern Commonwealth began in 1931 when British parliament created the Statute of Westminster.
iv. The Commonwealth is composed of 54 countries now.

**35.4 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND**
The former British Empire comprised territories or colonies acquired by Britain in different parts of the world. For example, In the 19th century, the former British colonies of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland, etc. had partial representative governments but had Governors that (represented the Queen) administered these colonies. So, the link was therewith Britain. However, they were autonomous within the British Empire. Therefore, the Commonwealth of Nations replaced the old imperial system of the British Empire, the crown colonies, mandates, trust territories and protectorates, and dependences. A new system of partnership, involving sovereign and states (dominion and republics) that are of equal basis. The name ‘Commonwealth’ was adopted in 1951. However, Ireland ceased to be a member in 1949, South Africa in 1961; Burma left in 1948, etc. The headquarters of The Commonwealth is London. Meetings of this organisation are held once every two years, attended by heads of state and government of member states.

**Membership:** As at 1975, the total membership of the Commonwealth was 31, New Zealand joined in (1948), Malaysia (1957), Ghana (1957), Nigeria (1960), Cyprus (1961), Sierra Leone (1961) Uganda (1962), Trinidad and Tobago (1962), Jamaica (1962), Kenya (1963), Tanzania (1964), Malawi (1964), Malta (1964), Zambia (1964). The Gambia (1965), Guyana (1966), Botswana (1966), Lesotho (1966), Barbados (1966), Mauritius (1968), Swaziland (1968). But now, it has 54 members.

**Independence:** All members of the Commonwealth, whether monarchies or republics, are free to pursue their domestic and foreign policies.
(i) There should be equality in status, no subordination of one to another.
(ii) Every country should have unfettered and total control over her own affairs, domestic and foreign.

**35.5 THE QUEEN AS THE HEAD OF THE COMMONWEALTH**

The Queen as the Head of the Commonwealth was adopted in 1949, when the proposal for making India a republic within the Commonwealth was adopted and accepted. It was accepted because paying allegiance or being submissive to the Crown should not be the basis for a continued membership of the Commonwealth and that a republic can co-exist with a monarchy without jeopardising the benefits of membership. Her office was separated from the headship of the republic.

**35.6 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE COMMONWEALTH**

1. **Common understanding:** Promotion of common understanding among the members.
2. **Solution to problems:** This occurs in education, trade, science, medicine, agriculture, sports, etc.

5. **Discussion of problems:** To come together to discuss problems affecting member states.
6. **UN Charter:** To work within the framework of the UN Charter and for the promotion of international peace and security.

**35.7 ORGANS OF THE COMMONWEALTH**

**(A) The Prime Minister Conference:** This is the paramount organ of the Commonwealth.

Membership has to do with the heads of state and government of member states or their accredited representatives. This conference at the Kingston’s Prime Ministers’ Conference in 1964 agreed to establish a Commonwealth secretariat and it became a reality in 1965.

**Functions of the Prime Ministers’ Conference**

1. **Approval of budget:** This body receives and approves the budget of the organisation.
2. **Appointment of the Secretary-General:** The body appoints the Secretary-General of the organisation.
3. **Discussion of problems:** They discuss issues and problems as they affect member states and recommend measures or solutions to such problems.
4. **Power of sanction:** It can sanction or suspend a member state that does not respect the objectives upon which the organisation was founded. For example, Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth in 1995 for the abuse of human rights, i.e. the execution of Ken Saro Wiwa and other 8 Ogoni citizens.
5. **Receives reports:** It receives and approves the report of the organisation submitted to it by the secretariat.

**(B) The Secretariat**

The Secretariat is headed by a Secretary-General and is located in London. This organ was established after the prime ministers’ conference in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1965. Arnold Smith was the first Secretary-General (1965-1975), and he is from Canada, followed by Sir Shridath Ramphal (1975-1990) from Guyana. He was succeeded by Chief Emeka Anyaoka from Nigeria as the next Secretary-General (1992 - 2005). He was in turn replaced by Mr Don Mckinnon who was later replaced by Kamalesh Sharma. The current Secretary-General is Patricia Scotland of Dominican Republic. She has been the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth since 2016.

**Functions of the Secretariat**

1. **Annual conferences:** It organises the conferences of Heads of State and Government of members.
2. **Administrative and correspondence functions:** The secretariat also performs these two functions.
3. **Preparation of reports:** It prepares the reports of the organisation.

**35.8 GAINS DERIVABLE FROM COMMONWEALTH MEMBERSHIP**

1. **Scholarship:** There are Commonwealth scholarships for deserving students.
2. **Granting of loans:** The richer states help the poor ones through granting of loans or financial aid.
3. **Common problems:** Member states help discuss common problems, ensuring closer and friendly ties among them.
4. **Sporting activities:** Member states engage in sporting activities every four years, thereby strengthening the existing relationships among them.
5. **Legal system:** The legal system is similar and fashioned along the British pattern. The meeting of the commonwealth Law Association supports this point.
6. **Official language:** The English language is the official language. It makes for easy communication and understanding among members.
7. **Trading activities:** Member states of the commonwealth gain immensely from trading activities existing among them. The terms on any trading agreements are liberal, thereby creating a favourable atmosphere. e.g. Britain is one of Nigeria’s largest trading partner.
8. **Visit without visa:** The opportunity is there for citizens of some member countries to visit and interact among themselves without visas . Free movement is assured.
9. **Development:** Member countries can borrow money from other countries for their development programmes.
10. **Benefits:** Technical, scientific and educational benefits: experts in various fields are exchanged among the Commonwealth members.

13. **Common voice:** It enables member states to speak with a common voice on international issues.
14. **Employment opportunities:** The Common-wealth membership offers employment opportunities to qualified citizens of member states.

**35.9 PROBLEMS FACING THE COMMONWEALTH**

1. **Foreign policies:** Differences in foreign policies pursued by member states are a problem facing the organisation.
2. **The issues of EEC:** Another problem is Britain joining the European Economic Community (EEC).
3. **Regional or sub-regional groupings:** For example, the AU, ECOWAS and EEC. Much attention is now paid to these regional or sub-regional groupings than the Commonwealth.
4. **Problem of South Africa:** It created differences among members. Britain’s support for the apathetic policy and the then British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher’s insistence on non-sanction.
5. **No common currency:** Previously, member states have their currencies in pound sterling; but now, the case is different.
6. **Compliance with decisions:** Member states cannot be compelled to comply with its decisions like the UN. There is nobody or agency that can enforce compliance to its decisions.
7. **Restriction of movement:** It is no more granted to immigrants within the Commonwealth. For example, a Nigerian travelling to Britain should require a visa.
8. **Secession:** Member states can easily secede or pull out of the body.
9. **No charter:** The Commonwealth has no charter like some other international bodies, e.g. AU and UN; and as such, rules governing it are not properly streamlined.
10. **No common military and defence pact:** This is obtained in French communities, e.g. France and Cameroun military pact, Warsaw pact and NATO.
11. **Non-payment of annual subscriptions:** Inability of member states to pay their annual subscriptions is affecting the objectives and programmes of the organisation.
12. **Political instability:** Some of the member states of the Commonwealth, especially the developing ones, are constantly faced with political instability, e.g. military intervention in the political system.
13. **Introduction of visa:** Visa is introduced by some member states as a condition for entrance into some countries of the Commonwealth. This has created difficulties for prospective immigrants fleeing their countries on grounds of political persecution or economic recession. This has affected the ideals of the Commonwealth.
14. **Diversities of culture:** Racial and cultural differences are so pronounced among member states, and these at times affect social and cultural interactions.
15. **Inequality:** There is economic inequality among member states. Some of the countries are advanced economies while some are not. These advanced or developed economies can determine the direction of issues within the Commonwealth.
16. **Ideological differences:** There are ideological differences within the Commonwealth. This can stall the pursuance of a collective goal that the body is determined to achieve.

**35.10 THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS**
Attempts made by nations to establish international organisation were not sufficient enough to see them through. Besides, there was no political organisation with the intention of bringing nations together, settling disputes and averting wars of a critical dimension.

The League of Nations was established in 1919 to prevent an outbreak of another war after the 1st World War (1914 - 18) to remove some of the defects and causes of wars, and achieve international co-operation through the promotion of peace and security.

**35.11 REASONS UNDERLINING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS**

1. **To remove the causes of wars:** This was made possible by reducing procurement of national armaments to the barest minimum so as to be in line with national safety. Nations agreed to respect and to preserve, as against external aggression, the political independence as well as the territorial integrity of the members of the league.
2. **Disputes between nations:** In the event of disputes, procedures were in place to prevent such leading to war and that such disputes, if capable of producing war, should be submitted to arbitration or to judicial settlement or to inquiry by the League Council.
3. **Keeping the arrangement:** If a member should go to war, provision was made to help the member state that did not break the promises. Those states that broke the arrangement should face trade or financial sanctions.
4. **Protection of the covenants:** Similarly, the League Council should recommend to states the contribution to be made in terms of armed forces so as to protect the covenants of the League.
5. **Supervision of trade in arms and ammunition:** The League is entrusted with the supervision of trade in arms and ammunition for the common interest of the members. This is to enthrone peace and prevent wars.

**35.12 PERMANENT INSTITUTIONS OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS**

These institutions were to be created to fulfil the objects of the League.
There was to be in place:
(a) An Assembly
(b) A Council
(c) A Secretariat
(d) A Court of International Justice
(e) International Labour Officer

**(A) An Assembly:** Three delegates to represent a state with only one vote. Representation is on an equal footing.

**Function:** To deal with matters within their range of action, threatening or affecting world peace.

**(B) A council:** It is made up of 9 members of the five Great powers as permanent members and four non-permanent states were elected by the Assembly. Later, permanent members were reduced to 4 and non-permanent members increased to 9.

The principle of representation was to be maintained in the election of few countries into the council. This will come up periodically and it is to be conducted by the Assembly. Meetings of the council would be more frequent than the Assembly.

**Functions:**
(i) To carry on with the work of the League.
(ii) It appointed and controlled various committees.
(iii) The council was to appoint a Secretary-General with the majority of the Assembly members approving.
(iv) It was to prepare the agenda for the Assembly.
(v) To deal with issues, within the range of action of the League, affecting the peace of the world.

**(C) The Secretariat:** The permanent secretariat of the League was appointed by the Secretary-General with the consent of the council.

**Functions:**
(i) It provided the necessary continuity between one meeting of the Assembly or the council and the next meeting.
(ii) It collected materials before any proceedings of the Assembly or the council and carried out the decisions taken.

**Expenses:** Contributions were made by members of the League to cover most of the meeting expenses.

**(D) The Permanent Court of International Justice:** It was set up from 1920 to 1922 with the headquarters at the Hague, Netherlands. This court had 11 judges and 4 deputy judges elected for 9 years by the Assembly and the council.

**functions:**
(i) It settled disputes between states as were referred to it, with powers of judicial settlement.
(ii) It gave opinions on issues referred to it by the council or the Assembly.

**(E) International Labour Office:** This office tried to maintain and possibly secure fair and humane conditions of labour for men, women and children.

**35.13 ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS**

1. **Settlement of disputes:** The league helped in settling inter-state disputes especially when both parties in dispute are genuinely committed to peace, for example, a border dispute between Turkey and Iraq, 1924-26.
2. **Colonial administration:** It supported, through the mandate system, the standard of colonial administration.
3. **The minorities:** Attention was, to some extent, focused on the necessity for fair treatment of minorities.
4. **Court of International Justice:** This court delivered over 60 judgements.
5. **Improvement on the condition of labour:** Attempts were made to improve the condition of labour through the International Labour Office.
6. **Co-operation in economic and social matters:** Through the technical and social organisations, it helped in promoting international co-operation in economic and social matters.
7. **Health matters:** The health organisation of the League helped to co-ordinate the efforts of various European governments to combat cholera and small pox epidemics as well as to conduct research work on the prevention of such diseases as tuberculosis and malaria.
8. **Prevention of forced labour:** There was the prevention of forced labour, preventing it from maturing into full slavery, thus combating the traffic in women and children. It equally promoted child welfare and the eradication of drug trafficking.

**35.14 ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS**

1. **The league did not succeed in settling disputes between powerful states:** For example, the 1931 to 1933 Sino or China – Japan dispute.
2. **The League was not wide enough:** As the USA remained outside it and later Japan, Germany and Italy left the body.
3. **A tool of manipulation:** The league of Nations was a tool of manipulation in the hands of some powerful rich nations.
4. **Frequent secession:** Any nation can secede from the league without coercion or restraint.
5. **Representatives not elected:** Representatives at the League were appointed by the governments and not elected by the people of member states.
6. **Lack of sovereign power:** The league lacked all sovereign power to operate and formally ceased to exist in 1947.

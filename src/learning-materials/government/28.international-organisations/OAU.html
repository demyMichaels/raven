### **34. INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS 1: THE ORGANISATION OF AFRICAN UNITY (OAU) AFRICAN UNION (AU)/NEW PARTNERSHIP FOR AFRICA’S DEVELOPMENT (NEPAD)**

#### **34.1 PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES**
At the end of this chapter, students should be able to:
(1) List five international organisations.
(2) Explain the origin of these organisations.
(3) Discuss their aims and objectives.
(4) Discuss the achievements of each organisation.

#### **34.2 HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE**
The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) was founded on May 25, 1963 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Thirty independent Africans states attended the inaugural meeting. The organisation was intended to unite all African states against the forces of colonialism and imperialism and work towards the resolution of African socio-economic and political problems. The OAU is made up of all independent African states. Before the emergence of OAU as a regional body, three different groups with different ideologies and goals existed. This did not augur well for unity. AU is a better organisation than the former blocs it replaced.

1. **Casablanca group**: Ghana, Egypt, Morocco, Guinea, Mali and Algeria.
2. **Brazzaville or African and Malagasy group**: Cameroun, Congo Brazzaville, Ivory Coast, senegal, Niger Republic, etc.
3. **Monrovia Group**: Nigeria, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, etc.

At the signing of the charter in Addis Ababa, the existing three blocs were present but only Monrovia and Casablanca were dissolved while the Brazzaville or African and Malagasy group continued to exist. Therefore, OAU as a body came into existence on May 25, 1963. The headquarters is in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Currently, about 55 countries make up the body and they are all independent states. Eritrea was admitted as the 52nd member of the organisation at the summit of Heads of State and Government in June 1993 after obtaining its independence from Ethiopia on May 24, 1993. South Africa was equally re-admitted as the 53rd member of OAU after apartheid was dismantled. The 54th member is South Sudan. The newest member state is Morocco which joined in January 2017; this means Morocco is the 55th member.

**Points to note:**
- **Casablanca Group**: It was a radical group that called for the immediate political integration of Africa.
- **Monrovia Group**: It was a moderate bloc that demanded for a gradual political integration of African states.

#### **34.3 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF OAU**
1. **Promotion of unity**: It has the aims of promoting unity and solidarity among African states.
2. **Living condition**: To ensure good living standard for the people.
3. **Common defence**: Member states agreed that the individual jointly and co-operatively defend their territories against external aggression.
4. **Eradication of colonialism**: They agreed to work towards the eradication of all forms of colonialism and imperialism on the continent.
5. **Promotion of international peace**: Member states agreed to work together with other organisations, e.g. UN, to promote international peace.
6. **United front**: To have a united front on issues of global importance.

#### **34.4 PRINCIPLES OF OAU**
1. **Sovereignty**: All member states are sovereign; none should be under the control of any other state. Respect for sovereignty of states to be a major principle.
2. **Settlement of disputes**: They agreed in principle that all disputes among member states should be settled peacefully.
3. **Emancipation of African territories**: Working co-operatively to free the entire continent from colonial rule.
4. **Equality of states**: No state should dominate others. Equal rights should be granted to all member states.
5. **Policy of non-interference**: No member state has the right to interfere in the internal affairs of other member states.
6. **Policy of non-alignment**: Members have faith in the policy of non-alignment, and are expected to discuss and assess international issues objectively.
7. **Total condemnation of all forms of subversive activities**: political assassination perpetrated in neighbouring states or other states within the continent.

#### **34.5 ORGANS OR INSTITUTIONS OF OAU**
The following are the organs of OAU:
1. The Assembly of Heads of State and Government.
2. The Council of Ministers.
3. The General Secretariat.
4. The Commission of Mediation, Conciliation and Arbitration.
5. The Liberation Committee.

**(a) The Assembly of Heads of State and Government**
The Assembly of Heads of State and Government is the highest and most powerful of all the organs of the organisation. It is the body that takes final decision on matters affecting member states of the organisation. It is made up of heads of state and government of all member states. It meets once in a year. However, during emergency, an extraordinary meeting may be convened at the instance of a member country, but it can only hold if two-thirds of member states support it, and this is because issues or matters are mostly decided by two-thirds majority. Also, each state has one vote and voting is by simple majority. This Assembly has a chairman and usually, the head of state and government of the host country is usually the chairman for one year.

**Functions of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government**
1. **Appointment of Secretary-General**: This organ is responsible for the appointment of the Secretary-General of the organisation.

**(b) The Council of Ministers**
The council consists of foreign or external affairs ministers or any other ministers appointed by the government for this purpose. For example, the minister of external affairs in Nigeria is a member of this council. It meets twice a year, but an extra-ordinary meeting may be called and it requires two-thirds \(^2/_3\) approval of the member states. This council prepares the agenda for the meetings of heads of state and government and equally implements their decisions. This, therefore, makes it responsible to the Assembly of Heads of State. Each state has one vote and a quorum is formed by \(^2/_3\) of the body.

**Functions of the Council of Ministers**
1. **Preparation of the agenda**: The Council of Ministers prepares the agenda for the meetings of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government.

7. Salim Ahmed Salim of Tanzania (1989-2001). He is the last Secretary-General of the defunct OAU. The African Union (AU) has Essy Amara as its first Secretary-General.

**(d) The Commission of Mediation, Conciliation and Arbitration**
This organ was mainly set up to settle disputes among the member states of the organisation. About 21 members from different member states, make up this commission, and it is for a period of five years. It has Addis Ababa in Ethiopia as its headquarters. There is a president and a vice-president. Membership of this commission, their activities, etc. are determined by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government. To facilitate and promote the work of the organisation, other five specialised commissions were set up. These are:
1. Educational and Cultural Commission.
2. Economic and Social Commission
3. Health, Sanitation and Nutrition Commission
4. Defence Commission
5. Scientific, Technical and Research Commission.
Membership of these specialised commissions consists of the ministers concerned in their respective states or their designated representatives.

**(e) The Liberation Committee**
The liberation committee was set up in 1963 with headquarters at Dare-es-Salam in Tanzania.

**Purpose/Functions of the Committee**
1. **Assistance to African territories**: This committee was set up mainly to assist African territories who were still under colonial rule to gain independence.
2. **Financial support**: This body was to assist financially and materially, the liberation movements in Africa, e.g. SWAPO in Namibia and MPLA in Angola.

**Note**: The Liberation Committee has long ceased to exist because all African countries are now independent.

#### **34.6 ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE OAU**
1. **Served as a forum**: The organisation served as a forum for African leaders to discuss African affairs.
2. **United stand at the UN**: The organisation has allowed the African states to take a united stand at the UN.
3. **Attainment of independence**: The Liberation Committee of AU had supported nationalist movements in countries fighting for independence, e.g. Angola, Namibia and Mozambique.
4. **Settlement of disputes**: It contributed to the settlement of many disputes among African states. For example, AU played a useful role during the Nigerian civil war.
5. **Regional economic co-operation**: The Organisation of African Unity has encouraged regional and economic cooperation in Africa, e.g. ECOWAS.
6. **African Development Bank**: This bank has granted soft loans to member states for developmental programmes.
7. **Human rights**: It has contributed to the observance of human rights in African countries through the adoption of the African Charter on Human Rights.
8. **Eradication of apartheid**: AU played a crucial role in the eradication of apartheid in South Africa, For example, at the Abuja Summit of 1991, member states resolved to continue supporting the policy of sanction against South Africa.
9. **African Economic Community (AEC)**: The treaty establishing this community was signed in Abuja in 1991. One of the goals of the community is for a sustained socio-economic development of member states of the organisation.
10. **Promotion of world peace**: AU, in cooperation with other international bodies, e.g. UN. etc, has contributed to the promotion of world peace and security.

#### **34.7 WEAKNESSES OR PROBLEMS OF THE ORGANISATION OF AFRICAN UNITY**
1. **Political instability**: Due to frequent changes of government, internal strife and conflicts, many African states are politically unstable.
2. **Colonial experience**: Some member states of the organisation still owe allegiance to their former colonial masters.
3. **No standing army**: The OAU as an organisation has no standing army. Areas where there are conflict that require military interventions cannot receive appropriate attention.
4. **Payment of dues**: Irregular payment of dues by member states is affecting the attainment of the goals of the organisation.
5. **Decisions of the organisation may not be binding on the members**: This is because all member states are sovereign states.
6. **Neo-colonialism**: Member states of the organisation depend largely on developed countries for financial assistance and this makes them susceptible to manipulation in the hands of these developed countries.
7. **Poor leadership**: Most African states are yet to have reliable, honest and dedicated leadership committed to the ideals of the organisation.
8. **The problem of refugees**: Most African countries are having internal or external conflicts, resulting in people fleeing their countries or homes to other countries or places where there is peace. These refugees become serious socio-economic problems to those countries.
9. **Differences in ideology**: African states belong to different socio political blocs. This has been affecting decision-making and implementation of the organisation’s programmes.
10. **Border conflicts**: Border clashes have been a regular feature on the continent. AU, as a body, has no capability to forestall such.
11. **Shortage of fund**: Some of the member states of the organisation are not paying their dues and when they do, it is usually not prompt. This has been creating problems in the implementation of the objectives and goals of the organisation.
12. **Poverty**: Most of the countries are poor and so, their economies are heavily dependent on foreign powers. Therefore, there is the tendency for these African states to be more loyal to these foreign powers than to the AU itself.
13. **Principle of non-interference**: The principle of non-interference in internal affairs of member states. This prevented AU from playing an active role in major crises in member countries.
14. **Inter-state boundaries**: Disputes are common as a result of inter-state boundaries in Africa, e.g. Eritrea/Ethiopia, Nigeria/ Cameroon, Senegal/Mauritania and Libya/ Chad.
15. **Existence of sub-regional organisations**: e.g. ECOWAS and MANO River Union.
16. **Domination**: The fear of domination nursed by some member countries of the organisation.
17. **Internal or domestic strife**: Conflict, violence and breakdown of law and order in some member states leading to divided attention and lack of support for the Organisation.
18. **Rivalry**: This could be noticed among the powerful member states for supremacy.

#### **34.8 ORGANISATION OF AFRICAN UNITY (OAU)/AFRICAN UNION(AU) Historical Perspective**
The 37th summit of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) held between the 9th and 13th of July, 2001 was the last summit of the 38-year-old organisation. It also marked the birth of a new organisation known as the African Union (AU) which was adopted by 50 of the 53 member countries. Consequently, on Monday, July 8, 2002, African leaders formally marked the end of the Organisation of African Unity and the birth of African Union in its place. Forty (40) of the continent’s 53 presidents, heads of government and monarchs gathered in Durban, South Africa, to inaugurate the new union.

**Characteristics of the AU**
1. The new union is to be people-oriented.
2. The union’s anthem called Unity Afrika was composed by veteran award-winning South African musicians, Caiphus Semeny and Jonas Gwangwa.
3. Thabo Mbeki, the president of South Africa, became the first A.U. Chairman.

**Charter of the AU**
1. The draft act for the A.U. provides for the right of member states to request intervention in order to restore peace and security.
2. The proposed charter for AU also gives the Union the right to “intervene in a member state pursuant to a decision of the Assembly in respect of grave circumstances, namely war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity”.
3. The draft charter also provides “that any member state that fails to comply with the decisions and policies of the union may be subject to sanctions”.

**Institutions of AU**
1. **Establishment of Committee of Intelligence and Security Services of Africa (CISSA)**.
   **Functions:**
   (i) To address Africa’s myriad of security issues
   (ii) Stability and development problems – looking at factors inhibiting stability and development.
   (iii) To be located in the office of the chairman of AU.

2. **African Union Constituent Act**
   This Act empowers members to intervene in any of AU’s member states where massive violence and disorder are taking place even if they are caused by misgovernance.
   This is a departure from the concept of non-interference in the domestic affairs of any member state which existed under the former OAU.
   Similarly, in the new order, it is going to be government to people and no more government to government.

3. **Economic, Social and Cultural Council of the A.U.**
   Established under the provision of Article 5 and 22 of the African Union Constituent Act.
   **Function:**
   (i) It is to be a vehicle for building a strong partnership between governments across the continent of Africa.
   The first President is Professor Wangari Mathai of Kenya and the first Deputy President is Mr. Ayodele Aderinwale of Nigeria.
   Other regions in the Assembly are: Central Africa, North Africa and Southern Africa.
   (ii) Peace and Security Council
   **Pan African Agency**
   Both were constituted under the Union Act with the mandate to advise the leadership of AU and to address new situations as they come up.

5. **The Secretariat (the Commission)**
   It will be like its European Union Counterpart.
   **Some of the features:**
   (i) To retain elements of AU, with a conference of heads of state and government as its top decision-making body.
   (ii) Foreign ministers of member states to be grouped into an Executive Council. The conference of heads of state will decide on the powers of the foreign ministers.
   (iii) Agreement was reached that the AU’s Executive Commission will be based in Ethiopia’s Capital, Addis Ababa, the home of the AU.

6. **African Union Parliament**
   African parliamentarians will for the first time debate on continental-wide issues at a new Pan-African parliament.
   The parliament with MPS from 53 member states of the African Union has been officially inaugurated in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
   The Commission’s 1st Chairman Alpha Oumar Konare said that the members will craft the political map of the continent.
   At the inauguration, only 190 MPS from 38 countries were sworn in.
   **Function:** To advise the heads of state and government of the African Union.

7. **Structure of the African Union**
   The African Union is modelled in part after the European Union (E.U.)
   The 4th Ordinary Session of Assembly of African Union (AU) came up with the following decision:
   (i) African Parliament – to be located in South Africa.
   (ii) African Central Bank in West Africa
   (iii) African Investment Bank in North Africa
   (v) African Court of Justice in East Africa

The African Union will be built on six strong pillars:
1. An institutional framework with sufficient authority and capacity for implementing agreed decisions.
2. Regional infrastructure in transport, communication and energy.
3. Full private sector and civil society participation.
4. Sustainable development through the adoption of regional strategies and policies.
5. Promotion of intra-regional trade at a level that matches the potential of the continent.
6. Equitable burden-sharing in matters affecting the continent and the Union’s administration.

It is gratifying to note that the African Union will not only be building on existing regional blocs, but also broadening the objectives of economic co-operation and regional integration.

There will also be shared values – peace and stability, democracy and good governance and respect for the human rights of the people.

**Proposed Gains of the African Union**
(1) Regional economic co-operation and integration can also make it possible for the Union to collectively build integrative infrastructures in transport, communications and energy which would otherwise be too costly for some African countries to undertake or embark upon.
(2) In the competitive world of globalisation and liberalisation, co-operation and integration offer the only chance to be relevant and to speak with one voice in international negotiations.

This strategy (proposed gains) was to overcome three fundamental development constraints characterising African economies which include:
(i) The small-sized economies of many countries.
(ii) The lack of structural complementaries as manifested in the narrow set of similar low-value added primary agricultural and mineral export commodities.
(iii) The dependence on the import of intermediate and capital goods.

Regional integration was viewed as offering opportunities for market expansion, economic scale and diversification of Africa’s economic base.

Consequently, a plethora of regional and sub-regional integration institutions were established.

**Problems that may Likely Confront AU**
Some analysts are of the view that the Union may likely inherit many problems from its progenitor. These problems may include:
1. Debts which are up to the tune of about 40 million U.S. dollars.
2. Problem of resources and political will to attain its lofty goals.
3. The Union is likely to become another toothless bull dog like its predecessor, the OAU.
4. The Union may not have the power to rein in the despots and corruption-riddened governments that plague the African continent.
5. Africa’s participation in world trade has remained at an insignificant stage (in the neighbourhood of about two percent while intra-African trade has lowered around ten percent).
6. The absence of any significant change in the structure of African economies.
7. Exports are still confined to basic minerals and primary agricultural products.

However, a critical review of the integration process in Africa will reveal more than ten (10) reasons for past failures. The most obvious of these are:
(i) Lack of political will by African governments to subordinate domestic political and economic interests to supranational institutions with long-term goals.
(ii) Lack of good governance and rule of law.
(iii) Inadequate mechanisms for equitable sharing of the costs and benefits of regional arrangements.
(iv) The pervasive weaknesses in regional integration structures, such as weak industrial structures, the absence of intra-industry linkages, poor infrastructure and non-convertibility of currencies.
(v) Lack of policy consistency and credibility as well as antipathy to market-oriented state domination of production through inefficient parastatals.
(vi) The overlapping memberships of several regional groupings.
(vii) Lack of private sector and civil society involvement.

**Aims/Goals of AU**
1. A commitment to democracy and fundamental human rights
2. A commitment to economic development
3. To end conflicts in Africa
4. To eradicate poverty, disease, wants and ignorance in the continent
5. To foster deep and strong political, economic and social integration among member states.
6. To develop and introduce a single currency for the African continent.

#### **34.9 NEW PARTNERSHIP FOR AFRICA’S DEVELOPMENT (NEPAD)**
The New Partnership for Africa’s Development should be seen as a home-grown African initiative to overcome the age-long obstacles to African development. It is a vision and strategic framework for the socio-economic and political development of Africa.

This body is assumed to be in partnership with the international community, the Group of 8 industrialised countries:
(i) The Russian federation
(ii) Germany
(iii) France
(iv) Italy
(v) Japan
(vi) United kingdom
(vii) Northern Ireland
(viii) United States of America

**Note**: What is now popularly known by the acronym NEPAD came into being upon the joining together of the millennium partnership for the African Recovery Programme (MAP) and the OMEGA plan, at the request of the organisation of African Unity (AU) now the African Union (AU).

It was once known as the New African Initiative. It came into existence in October 2001 out of the several plans and discussions which lasted some years between South Africa’s president, Thabo Mbeki; Nigeria’s president Olusegun Obasanjo; and Algeria’s President, Abdelaziz Boutefilka.

At this level of meetings and discussions of these presidents, one could deduce that they were committed towards evolving a new pattern of development and partnership for Africa and this is where the concept of NEPAD was actualised.



Here is the text from the provided images, integrated into the logical flow of the chapter on NEPAD.

***

### **34.9 NEW PARTNERSHIP FOR AFRICA’S DEVELOPMENT (NEPAD)** (Continued)

The actualisation of the objectives of this concept (NEPAD) rests squarely with Africans, even though NEPAD is in partnership with the G8. The following line of actions were initiated by African leaders before the formation of NEPAD:
1. The Final Act of Lagos 1980.
2. The Lagos Plan of Action for the Economic Development of Africa (1980 – 2000).
3. The Africa’s Priority Programme for Economic Recovery (APPER) (1986 – 1990).
4. The African Alternative Framework to Structural Adjustment Programme for Socio-Economic Recovery and Transformation, AAF – SAP (1989).
5. The African Charter for Popular Participation for Development (1990).
6. The Compact Programme for African Recovery (2000).

#### **Objectives of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)**
(i) A commitment to good governance as a precondition for economic growth.
(ii) Eradication of poverty from the African continent within a stipulated time.
(iii) Strengthening democracy and the Rule of Law in Africa.
(iv) Achieving peace, security and stability in Africa.
(v) Acceleration of the empowerment of women in African countries so as to ensure gender equality.
(vi) To make Africa attractive to both domestic and foreign investors.
(vii) Reduction of corruption in Africa.
(viii) To halt the marginalisation of Africa in the globalisation process.
(ix) To increase investment in human resource development.
(x) The enhancement of standard of living of the people of Africa.
(xi) Promotion of sound economic management and people-centred development.
(xii) Development of a new partnership with the industrialised countries and multilateral institutions.
(xiii) To achieve and sustain an average rate of GDP growth of 7% per annum for 15 years.
(xiv) To strengthen Africa’s capacity to mobilize external resources for its development.
(xv) To ensure that the continent achieves the agreed international development goals (MDGs & SDGs).
(xvi) To accelerate the rate of integration in Africa.

#### **Arguments against NEPAD**
1. Some political analysts have seen the creation of NEPAD as another neo-colonial tendency of the West to exploit Africa.
2. Poor leadership and high rate of corruption facing the continent are negative pointers capable of endangering the set goals and objectives of NEPAD.
3. The un-ending conflict situations in Africa, as a result of East and West ideological differences, race, religion, etc. can stall every efforts at realising the goals of this new body.
4. Efforts at realising the committed goals of NEPAD may be jeopardised as a result of some domestic problems of member states.

#### **United States of America’s Commitment To NEPAD**
The United States of America has, in recent times, made itself committed to the development of African countries through the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).
Tabling this before the United Nations Council, United States permanent representative to the United Nations, Ambassador John D. Negroponte, stated that NEPAD goals include the following:
1. Recognition of African leaders initiative to end conflict rocking the continent.
2. An antidote necessary to hasten progress by taking concrete actions to promote peace and stability.
3. Consolidating democracy and providing sound economic management and people-centred development.
4. NEPAD is Africa’s future mapped out by Africans on behalf of Africans.

Negroponte commended the pivotal roles former presidents Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Abdullahi Wade of Senegal have been playing in developing and guiding the implementation of NEPAD.

While presenting the efforts of the USA at helping the success of the programme, he said:

“The millennium challenge account by U.S. draws on one of the essential lessons of development: countries prosper when their governments function justly, effectively and transparently. This requires the rule of law, independent judiciary and respect for the rights of citizens, including the right to choose their own representatives.”

CHARACTERISTICS OF GOVERNMENT
The following are the attributes of government
as an institution ofthe state:

Law: It is a guide to the activities, beliefs
and behaviour of the citizens. These are
laws made by the government and
entrenched in the constitution. The actions
of those in government, their limitations,
rights, duties and obligations of citizens
are all outlined in the constitution.

Political power:
The political power
which the government has is in consonance
with the people's will to obey laws and
policies made by the state.

3.
Revenue:
Government needs enough
revenue for the enormous task facing it.


4. Work-force: The civil service possesses
adequate personnel for policy-making and
implementation, interpretation and
punishment ofoffenders.


5.
People's legitimate support: A
government should be able to earn for itself
legitimate support from the people and this
produces peace and stability in a system.

6. Welfare services: Provision of some
essential services, e.g. water, electricity,
housing, etc. should be made to improve
people's well-being. This is essential for
any responsible government.

permanent, especially one that is based on
people's participation
(elective
government), hence the adoption of
periodic elections. In some systems, it

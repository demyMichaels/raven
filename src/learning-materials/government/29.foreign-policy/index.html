**33. NIGERIA AND THE WORLD: THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF NATIONS (FOREIGN POLICY)**

**33.1 PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES**

At the end of this chapter, students should be able to:
(1) Discuss the interdependence of nations.
(2) Explain Nigeria’s international interaction in terms of:
(i) Economic interaction;
(ii) Political interaction; and
(iii) Cultural/Social interaction.
(3) Identify the advantages and disadvantages in interacting with other nations.

Nigeria’s foreign policy:
(4) Define foreign policy.
(5) Examine the factors that influence Nigeria’s foreign policy.
(6) Discuss the origin of non-alignment.
(7) Assess the effectiveness of non-alignment in foreign politics.

The Reason: There is interdependence and interrelationship existing among nations of the world. No nation is an island. Nations of the world have become so closely related to one another as a result of breakthrough in communication, formation of different types of organisations, etc. Therefore, development of a nation cannot be done without relating or interacting with other nations. In the process of these interactions, benefits are derived in different areas of human endeavour.

Nigeria interacts with many nations of the world, politically, economically, socially, culturally, etc., and this is made possible through the establishment of high commissions, embassies and consulates abroad. Nigeria equally plays host to many foreign missions located in Nigeria.

Nigeria also belongs to international, regional or sub-regional organisations, e.g. United Nations (UN), African Union (AU) and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). She is also a member of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

**33.2 THE NEED FOR INTERACTION**
1. **Political reason for interaction:** States agree to interact through the formation of different organisations, e.g. UN and AU. This is done in order to create the opportunity for a peaceful and secure world and good government, and to avoid the interference of one state or states in others, which may result in war of worldwide dimension. Therefore, member states of such organisations are made to abide by the principles governing such organisations.
2. **Economic reason for interaction:** Natural resources are unevenly distributed worldwide and nations can only benefit from one another through such interactions. Nations get what they don't have through such interactions, and this has added impetus to the economic advancement of most states.
3. **Socio/cultural reason for interactions:** This is very important because it promotes love and friendship among nations and eliminates conflicts. Nations are brought together to share things in common and derive some benefits in the areas of culture, sports, football, e.g. World Cup competition staged every four years and also the staging of musical concerts.

**33.3 ADVANTAGES OF INTERACTIONS AMONG NATIONS OF THE WORLD**

1. **Peace and security:** Through membership and interactions existing in these international or regional organisations, e.g. UN and AU, member states are meant to abide by the principles governing these bodies, thereby promoting peace and security worldwide.

2. **Closer relationship:** Especially in the areas of sports, musical and cultural concerts, etc., nations are drawn closer mutually. They relate intimately with one another and by so doing, conflicts are eliminated.

3. **Economic advancement:** Interactions bring about states benefiting from others that are more economically viable, especially in the areas of natural endowment, technology etc.

4. **Cultural and social benefits:** States benefit immensely from others, especially through sports, cultural exchange, etc. They learn from one another as it brings them closer together.

5. **Removal of interference:** Political interaction removes the tendency of one state or more interfering in the domestic affairs of other states or even trying to dominate others.

6. **Foreign aids:** Interactions among states can attract technological, financial and technical aids to developing countries from the developed ones.

7. **Investment opportunities:** Also, the coming together of nations can open doors to investment opportunities.

8. **Establishment of political organisations:** The existence of interaction among nations has led to the establishment of political organisations, e.g. UN and AU associations and blocs, high commissions, embassies, etc.

9. **Spread of civilisation and modernisation:** Interactions among nations of the world can spread civilisation and modernisation and even help to promote tourism as well.

10. **Reduction of hostilities:** The hostilities among nations of the world are reduced to the barest minimum through interactions.

**33.4 DISADVANTAGES OF INTERACTIONS AMONG NATIONS OF THE WORLD**

1. **Cultural/Social problems:** Through interactions in sports, cultural concerts, etc., social problems such as immoral acts, promiscuity, indecency, prostitution, etc. could be exported to some countries.

2. **Interference of states:** Developed nations can still interfere in the domestic affairs of the less developed nations because of the economic benefits the less developed countries are deriving from the developed nations.

3. **Neo-colonialism:** Interactions among states, economically, politically, etc. can lead to neo-colonialism, and this can make nonsense of the hard-won independence of these developing states from their erstwhile colonial masters.

4. **Inferior or poorly produced goods:** Interactions among states can lead to some developed countries making some of the Third World countries dumping ground for their inferior or poorly produced goods.

5. **Control of states:** Political and economic interactions associated with the membership of some of the organisations, e.g. UN and IMF can bring about control of the sovereignty of less powerful states, as most of these organisations are controlled by the big powers.

**33.5 NIGERIA’S FOREIGN POLICY**
**Definition:** Foreign policy refers to the decisions and actions taken by a state to pursue her interests within the global system. The ability of a nation to influence the decisions and actions of other nations within the country of nations is of great importance.

Nigeria’s foreign policy can be defined as the totality of Nigeria’s interaction within the international system. In defining and planning their foreign policies, governments, most essentially, consider the enhancement of national interests at the international level. National or domestic interest is a major factor in foreign policy formulation.

Nigeria maintains relations with other nations of the world and maintains many diplomatic missions, i.e. embassies, high commissions and consulates abroad. Nigeria also plays host to many foreign missions in Nigeria.

**33.6 NIGERIA’S FOREIGN POLICY SINCE INDEPENDENCE**
Since independence, there has been a succession of military and civilian administrations whose foreign policies differed greatly in terms of ideology, style, substance and even the personality of the leaders. Also, the dynamics of foreign policy itself demand that for an effective foreign policy, resources must be in proportion to the necessary demands and global obligations of the actors. Nigeria’s foreign policy, therefore, should be examined differently.

A former foreign affairs minister of Nigeria, Major-General Ike Nwachukwu(retd.) grouped Nigeria’s foreign policy since independence into different phases:
1. The Balewa era (1960-66)
2. Crises and civil war period (Gowon period, 1966-70)
3. Post-war era of Gowon (1970-73): Reconstruction, Reconciliation and Rehabilitation.
4. The Muritala/Obasanjo era (1975-79)
5. The Second Republic era (1979-83)
6. The Buhari Idiagbon era (1983-85)
7. The Babangida era (1985-93)
8. The Shonekan/Abacha era (1993-June98)
9. The Abubakar era (June 1998-May 1999).

Each of the regimes or administrations operated according to the prevailing domestic or national and international environment, including the goals set by each of the leaders/administrations.

The following are the names of the external affairs ministers that played crucial roles in Nigeria’s foreign policy:
1. Dr. Jaja Nwachukwu (1962-65).
2. Alhaji Nuhu Bamali (1965-66).
3. Dr. Okoi Arikpo, Commissioner for External Affairs (July 1966-July 1975).
4. Major-General Joseph Garba (1975-1979).
5. Major-General Henry Adefope (January 1979 to September 1979).
6. Professor Ishaya Audu (1979-1983).
7. Chief Emeka Anyaoku (October-December 1983).
8. Professor Ibrahim Gambari (1984-1985).
9. Professor Bolaji Akinyemi (1985-1987).
10. Major-General Ike Nwachukwu (1987-89 and 1990-92).
11. Alhaji Rihwan Lukman (1989-1990).
12. Tom Ikimi (1995-1998).

20. Henry Odein Ajumogobia (2010-2011)
21. Olugbenga Ashiru (2011-2013)
22. Viola Onwuliri (supervising 2013-2014)
23. Aminu Bashir Wali (2014-2015)
24. Geoffrey Ouycama (2015 till date) appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari.

**The Balewa Era (1960-66)**
The Balewa era tried to consolidate by joining international organisations. It was involved in the devolonisation process in Africa and stood against the apartheid policy in South Africa. The administration recognised Africa as the centrepiece of Nigeria’s foreign policy. The governmental so broke diplomatic relations with France over the testing of an atomic bomb in the Sahara Desert. Also, Ian Smith’s Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDR) in Rhodesia in 1965 was vehemently opposed by the administration. It supported the expulsion of South Africa from the Commonwealth in 1961, liaison played a crucial role in the formation of OAU in May 25, 1963. OAU is now known as the African Union.

**Crises and Civil War/Gowon Era (1966-75)**
The crisis and civil war/Gowon era was the era that nearly witnessed the break-up of the country. Our foreign policy shifted emphasis from the West to the East. Most of the weapons used in prosecuting the civil war came from the East. The post-war era of this administration was the application of the 3Rs (Reconstruction, Reconciliation and Rehabilitation). The administration accepted the principle of non-interference in the sovereignty of African states, respect for the principles governing the AU and UN. Also, it played a crucial role in the establishment of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and financial assistance made to the Liberation Committee of the A.U.

**Murtala/Obasanjo Era (1975-1979)**
The Murtala/Obasanjo administration favoured decolonisation and self-determination of African states. The events in Angola were a case in point. The regime supported MPLA, Augustino Neto’s popular movement for the liberation of Angola against UNITA, FNLA, even though some western countries reacted negatively.

The strained relations which resulted from this, especially with Britain and some western countries, led to the nationalisation of British Petroleum (now African Petroleum) and Barclays Bank (now Union Bank of Nigeria). It also gave its weight to the struggle against apartheid policy in south Africa by sponsoring the World Conference for Action Against Apartheid held in August 1977 in Lagos.

In 1978, a national agricultural programme was inaugurated by this administration known as “Operation Feed the Nation” (OFN).

**Shagari Era (1979-83)**
The Shagari era was the Second Republic civilian administration in Nigeria. The administration supported Zimbabwe’s independence. This action represented Nigeria’s avowed stand on the issue of decolonisation. However, the foreign policy of this administration was not smooth sailing because efforts were made to please the colonial masters.

**The Buhari / Idiagbon Era (1983-85)**
The Buhari / Idiagbon regime expelled West Africans living illegally in the country. In early 1985, about one million illegal aliens were expelled; the land borders were closed to check smuggling, the inflow of illegal immigrants as well as currency trafficking. These measures were aimed at consolidating domestic national interest in the nation’s foreign policy objectives.
This also came with its strained relations with West African states. Relations with Britain also went very sour, especially with Umaru Dikko’s affair.

**The Babangida Era (1985-93)**
The Babangida’s administration tried to bring back Nigeria into the forefront of African international relations. Efforts were made to move away slightly from political objectives to economic restructuring. A good number of trade and economic missions were undertaken. Germany, China, Brazil, Japan, Argentina, etc., for example, visited Nigeria to discuss possible areas of co-operation. To strengthen South-Southco-operation, Nigeria courted Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, Korea, Hong Kong, Zimbabwe, etc. to find areas of possible economic and technical co-operation.

The Babangida administration passed a decree and encouraged African states to do same against the dumping of toxic and radioactive wastes on the continent. The administration is noted to have re-established diplomatic ties between Nigerian and Israel. It also established a technical aid corps programme for African states.

**Conflict Resolution:** In this area, Babangida’s regime sent troops to some troubled areas in the world. In 1990, a full-scale war broke out in Liberia. This became a great concern to Babangida’s regime which at the 13th Summit of ECOWAS held in Banjul, the Gambia, in May 1990, proposed the need to set up a standing mediation committee charged with addressing conflicts issues in the West African sub-region.

This later resulted in the formation of the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG). The group was committed to restoring peace and normalcy in Liberia. Also, Babangida launched a N100 million solidarity fund in Lagos for Namibia when South West Africa People’s Organisation’s (SWAPO) leader, Sam Nujoma, visited Nigeria.

**Transition programme:** As part of its transition programme to democracy (1986-93), the Babangida regime inaugurated a Directorate for Social Mobilisation, also known as Mass Mobilisation for Self-reliance, Economic Recovery and Social Justice (MAMSER). The purpose of establishing MAMSER was to shape a political culture that would be congenial to a democratic system.

**Centre for Democratic Studies:** In 1990, the IBB administration also established the Centre for Democratic Studies (CDS) in Abuja, to conduct research and organise seminars on democratisation for government officials. This government also introduced the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP).

**Shonekan / Abacha Era (1993 - June 1998)**
The Shonekan / Abacha administration helped in ushering in peace in Liberia. After seven years of war, a democratic government was set up, headed by Charles Taylor while President Ahmed Kabbah’s civilian government was restored after Koroma’s military Junta was removed in Sierra Leone. Also demonstrated was Nigeria’s belief about Africa as the centrepiece of Nigeria’s foreign policy.

However, the regime adopted a confrontational posture with the international community. The administration was accused of abuse of human rights; and subsequently, sanctions were clamped down on the country from the West and the member nations of The Commonwealth, etc. Nigeria was alienated and her leadership position in Africa was threatened.

**The Abubakar Era (June 1998 - May 1999)**
The Abubakar-led administration embarked on reconciliation with her friends and the world community to correct the poor image the country was plunged into during the regime of the late General Sani Abacha. The Abubakar-led administration succeeded in returning Nigeria to its rightful place while evolving an action plan that would see Nigeria through in years to come.

**33.10 AFRICA AS THE CENTREPIECE OF NIGERIA’S FOREIGN POLICY**

The origin of this concept, “Africa, the centrepiece of Nigeria’s foreign policy” could be traced to the administration of the First Republic in Nigeria (1960-66) headed by the then prime minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Belewa. He maintained that: We belong to Africa and as such Nigeria would pursue realistic African policies. Africa should be given a pride of place in Nigeria’s foreign policy formulation. Other governments after Balewa’s, especially the Murtala/Obasanjo administration, pursued this policy in practical terms.

The following are the principles of the concept, Africa, the centrepiece of Nigeria’s foreign policy:
1. Developing programmes for possible assistance to other African states and fostering understanding among them.
2. The belief in the sovereignty and equality of African states.
3. Working towards the de-colonisation of African continental under colonial rule.
4. Respect for and non-interference in the domestic affairs of other African states.
5. To support the struggle against apartheid policy and its eradication in South Africa.
6. To oppose aggression, support the demand for restoration of fundamental human rights in Africa and the world in general.
7. Promoting friendly association among independent African states.

**33.11 REASONS FOR THE ADOPTION OF AFRICA AS THE CENTREPIECE OF NIGERIA’S FOREIGN POLICY**

1. **Size and population:** With her size and population on the continent added to its enormous wealth, Nigeria has a task to accomplish for African states.
2. **Ideological rivalries:** Toremind Africans of the ideological rivalries that have penetrated Africa, the danger inherent in this and to pursue and unite African efforts in preventing Africa from becoming the theatre of world crises.
3. **Inter-territorial communication:** To cooperate with African states for an improved inter-territorial communication and transport facilities on the continent and to encourage African states to pool their resources together and develop higher education and research programmes.
4. **Decolonisation of African states:** Nigeria made Africa the centrepiece of her foreign policy because of the refusal of some colonial masters to grant independence to some African territories then under colonial rule. Nigeria, after her independence, opposed colonial rule and supported the struggle for de-colonisation of African continent.
5. **Location:** Geographically, Nigeria is located in Africa and it is natural that sister African states should first receive Nigeria’s attention before other states of the world. Africa, therefore, was given a pride of place by most Nigerian leaders.
6. **Assistance:** To provide assistance to other African states and foster understanding among them.

5. **Initiation of peaceful settlement of crises:** This has been done in countries such as Chad, Liberia, Sudan, Somalia and Sierra Leone.

6. **Peaceful resolution of disputes with her neighbours:** This can be seen in the dispute between Nigeria and Cameroun over the Bakassi Peninsula.

7. **Participation in peace-keeping operations in Africa** for example, in Congo, Chad and Liberia.

8. **Active participation in cultural and sporting activities,** e.g. All African Games and FESTAC 1977.

**33.14 PROBLEMS OF AFRICA AS CENTREPIECE OF NIGERIA'S FOREIGN POLICY**

1. **Financial burden:** It imposes a heavy financial burden on Nigeria.

2. **Loss of lives:** It leads to loss of lives through peace-keeping operations and liberation activities, e.g. Congo, Liberia and Sudan.

3. **Brain drain:** It leads to brain drain from Nigeria to other African states.

4. **Influx of citizens:** It led to the influx of citizens of other countries to Nigeria for greener pasture, e.g. Ghana in the 1970s and 1980s and now Niger and Mali.

5. **Hostilities:** Some African countries which benefited from the policy later became hostile and unfriendly to Nigeria, e.g. Angola, Liberia, South Africa, and Chad.

**Major Objectives of the Foreign Policy in West African Country**
(i) The promotion of unity and solidarity among African states, for example, sponsoring many resolutions which led to the collapse of apartheid in South Africa.
(ii) The termination of racial, colonial and neo-colonial influences in Africa, for example, providing financial and military aid to the liberation movements in Africa.

**33.15 NON-ALIGNMENT**
**Definition:** Non-alignment may be defined as non-commitment of a nation to either the West or the East on any international issue. It is mostly associated with neutrality in the face of mounting tension in the world, especially between the super powers in the era of Cold War. Non-alignment is a foreign policy orientation which allows nations (especially the Third World countries) to discuss and assess international issues objectively, not considering whether the West or the East has anything to offer.

**33.16 ORIGIN OF NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT**
It is an international movement drawn from different countries of the world and mostly Third World countries in Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia, Europe, etc. The major aim of this movement is the adoption of a non-confrontational posture or approach on world issues. The founding fathers of this movement – Josef Tito of Yugoslavia, Jawarahal Nehru of India, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, etc. They met in Yugoslavia between 18th and 19th of June, 1956 to discuss the rising tension in the world and the effect of this on world peace and security. Also, it was a reaction to the Soviet Union and the United States of America as the two greatest world powers and subsequently, the emergence of the era of the Cold War between the super powers. The coming together of 25 states at the conference called by Tito in Belgrade, Yugoslavian 1961, eventually saw the formation of Non-aligned movement. As at 2018, the movement had 120 members, 17 observer countries and 10 observer organisations.

However, people see this movement differently from other organisations of international repute like the UN Non-Aligned Movement has no charter or organs that are supposed to play key roles in the activities of the movement. However, indications are that moves are being made for the creation of important organs or institutions.
The creation of the post of a chairman and the holding of the summit every three years, etc. are pointers to this fact.

**33.20 PROBLEMS OF NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT**
The following are the major problems facing the movement:
1. **No specific features:** This body has no features of a well defined international body e.g. a charter, organs or institutions of a well established international body.
2. **Poverty:** Majority, if not all, of members of the movement are poor. Some members, therefore, have to dance to the tune of either the West or the East for one form of assistance or the other.
3. **No military set-up:** It has no military establishment of its own to enforce or compel obedience to its resolutions.
4. **Failure to remain neutral:** Non-aligned movement was supposed to be a neutral body, but ironically, it could not live up to this ideal.
5. **Differences in ideological stance:** Some states are for capitalism and others for socialism. This has been affecting the reality of the movement and the objectives it avowed to uphold.
6. **The control of IMF and World Bank:** The control of these two international banks by developed nations is affecting the policy of the movement. Economies of some members of the movement are in shambles and their going to the World Bank or IMF means that they should be ready to obey their conditionalities.
7. **Different cultural backgrounds:** The problems facing this movement are sometimes complex and difficult to tackle because the composition of the movement shows that they are people of different cultural backgrounds, histories, political systems, beliefs, etc.
8. **Test of military prowess:** Members are competing among themselves to acquire better weapons of modern warfare. Not only that, they also embark on building nuclear war heads. A case in points between India and Pakistan. Both countries recently tested their nuclear capabilities.
9. **Fear of domination:** There is the fear of domination being expressed, especially, by the poor states against the richer ones. This can affect the existence of oneness among them, because they exist in suspicion and fear.

**33.21 NIGERIA AND NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT: REASONS WHY NIGERIA ADOPTED THE PRINCIPLE**
Nigeria joined non-aligned movement in 1964 and the following are some of the reasons for adopting the principle.

1. **To interact and co-operate freely:** Nigeria adopted this policy in order to cooperate and interact freely with any nation within the comity of nations.
2. **To pursue its economic and political policies without any dictation or interference:** It was also adopted in order to allow Nigeria to pursue her economic and political policies without dictation or interference from either the East or the West.
3. **The mouthpiece of Africa:** Nigeria would be able to concentrate on issues affecting Africa since it regards itself as the mouthpiece of Africa on international issues, for example, recognition of MPLA in the Angolan crisis and the nationalisation of BP now (Forte Oil) and Barclays Bank now (Union Bank).
4. **Sovereignty:** In order to guide and protect the sovereignty of Nigeria.
5. **To give the leaders a free hand:** In putting the interests of the country above any other considerations in foreign policy decisions.

**Revision Questions**
1. Discuss the need for interaction among nations.
2. Highlight four advantages of interactions among nations of the world.
3. What is foreign policy?
4. Give reasons to show that Nigeria is a non-aligned nation. (WASSCE June, 1992).

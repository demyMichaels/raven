**14.2 PUBLIC OPINION**
**Definition:** Public opinion may be defined as the belief, values and attitudes which are commonly held and expressed by the majority of the people on a given public issue. In addition, it is about what people think concerning a particular national issue or question as proposed by the government.
Similarly, a consensus of opinion may be formed when majority of people in a given country have a similar or same opinion on any sensitive issue of national importance. For example, during Babangida’s administration, the issue of IMF came up whether Nigeria should go to IMF or not for a loan. In the end, there was a consensus of opinion; majority of the citizens objected to the idea and the government had to shelve the plan.

6. **Telephone calls:** Most of the radio stations in Nigeria today adopt this method by presenting phone-in programmes, a sort of random sampling of the opinions of the public.
7. **Opinion poll:** Government may use opinion polls to determine the mind and views of the people on a given issue, by interviewing a cross section of the public. Those interviewed will then represent the opinions of the citizens.

WANTS
Wants simply means the desire or wish to own goods or services that give satisfaction. 
Human beings want or need many things at a particular time. 
The basic needs or wants of man are food, shelter and clothing. 
As these basic needs are satisfied, other needs will arise. 
This is why we say that human wants are insatiable. 
This is because, human wants are unlimited while resources used in satisfying them are limited.

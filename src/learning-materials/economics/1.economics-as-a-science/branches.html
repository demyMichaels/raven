THE BRANCHES OF ECONOMICS  
Economics is divided into two main broad areas of Micro-economics and Macro-economics. Micro-economics is the study of the small units of the economy. \textit{Mikros} is a Greek word which means small. Micro-economics therefore involves the analysis of the decisions of the basic decision-making units of households, firms and governments. For instance, how an individual or a household earns income and how the income is spent are examples of micro-economics.

Macro-economics on the other hand deals with the aggregate economic problems of the society at large. \textit{Makros} is the Greek word for large. Macro-economics therefore studies such topics as inflation which is concerned with the general level of prices and as it affects everybody in the society, national income, aggregate level of unemployment, etc.

Economics can also be classified into pure and applied categories. Pure Economics involves a body of laws, theories or principles derived from the study of economic behaviour. Applied Economics is concerned with the use of laws, theories or principles in the analysis and solving of contemporary economic problems. There are other branches of Economics like: Monetary Economics which deals with money and banking; Public Finance which is about taxation, public revenue and expenditure; Business Economics which deals with trade, business organisation and accounting; Development Economics that handles economic planning or development plan and national economies; Mathematical Economics or Econometrics which deals with data collection, analysis and statistics; Demography that deals with population issues; Industrial Economics which talks about personnel management, labour and industrial relations, etc.

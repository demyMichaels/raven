've created an interactive physics learning app for the lever/torque balance problem shown in your image. Here's what the app includes:

🎯 Features
Interactive Lever Visualization
Animated seesaw that tilts based on torque balance
Three adjustable persons matching your problem setup (50kg left, Xkg and 15kg right)
Real-time physics - the lever responds smoothly to changes
Adjustable Controls
Mass sliders for each person (10-100kg range)
Distance sliders to adjust position from the pivot
All values update the visualization instantly
Torque Analysis Panel
Shows left torque, right torque, and the difference
Visual balance indicator (green = balanced, red = unbalanced)
🎯 Challenge Mode
Click "Take the Challenge" to solve the original problem
Enter your answer for mass X
Get instant feedback with explanations
Success modal celebrates correct answers
📐 Theory Section
Explains the physics of lever balance
Shows the formula: τ = m × g × d
Walks through the specific solution: X = 30 kg
Solution to the Problem
For balance: Left Torque = Right Torque

50 × 1.5 = X × 1.5 + 15 × 2
75 = 1.5X + 30
X = 30 kg
The app features a warm, scholarly aesthetic with an earthy color palette, supports both light and dark modes, and is fully responsive for mobile devices. Experiment with the sliders to explore how changing mass and distance affects the lever balance!

've created a comprehensive interactive physics learning app with three lab simulations based on your images. Here's what's included:

🔬 Three Interactive Labs
1. Atwood Machine with Friction
Simulates a mass on a table connected via pulley to a hanging mass
Adjustable parameters: both masses, friction coefficient (μ), gravity
Shows tension, friction force, acceleration, and net force
Animated motion when the system can accelerate
2. Static Equilibrium Analysis
Models a weight suspended by an angled string with horizontal force
Adjustable parameters: weight, string angle (θ), string length
Calculates tension (T), horizontal force (F), and distances
Visual vector decomposition of forces
3. Inclined Plane with Friction
Block on an inclined surface with friction
Adjustable parameters: mass, incline angle, friction coefficient
Shows weight, normal force, friction, and acceleration
Calculates critical angle where sliding begins
Animated sliding when conditions are met
✨ Key Features
LaTeX Formulas: All physics equations are rendered using KaTeX with step-by-step derivations
Real-time Calculations: Results update instantly as you adjust sliders
Interactive Animations: Start/Reset buttons for dynamic simulations
Force Vectors: Color-coded arrows showing all forces
Dark/Light Mode: Automatically adapts to system preference
Mobile Responsive: Works on all screen sizes
Status Indicators: Shows whether system is running or paused
Theory Sections: Explanations of the physical principles
The app uses a distinctive amber/teal color scheme with the Playfair Display and JetBrains Mono fonts for a premium scientific aesthetic rather than generic AI styling.

I've created a comprehensive Physics Lab - Interactive Simulations application for students! Here's what I built:

🧪 Features
Three Interactive Experiments:
Tension Forces (based on your diagram)

Simulates connected weights hanging from a fixed support (P, Q, R)
Interactive sliders to adjust each weight (1-10N)
Real-time tension calculations showing T₁, T₂, T₃
Visual force arrows and color-coded strings
Projectile Motion

Adjustable initial velocity, launch angle, and gravity
Animated projectile trajectory with trace path
Calculates max height, range, and flight time
Visual velocity vector and angle indicator
Simple Pendulum

Adjustable string length, initial angle, and bob mass
Real-time energy visualization (kinetic vs potential)
Period and frequency calculations
Demonstrates that mass doesn't affect period!
📚 Educational Elements:
Tooltips (hover over the "?" icons) explaining key concepts
Teacher's Tips with friendly explanations and relevant formulas
Live calculations that update as you adjust parameters
Color-coded visualizations for easy understanding
🎨 Design:
Beautiful warm gradient color scheme with orange accents
Responsive design that works great on mobile and desktop
Dark mode support (automatically detects your system preference)
Smooth animations and interactive feedback
Clean typography with distinctive fonts
💡 Teacher's Approach:
The app includes encouraging messages and explanations written in a friendly, supportive tone—helping students understand the "why" behind physics concepts rather than just the formulas.

Feel free to explore each experiment and adjust the values to see physics in action!

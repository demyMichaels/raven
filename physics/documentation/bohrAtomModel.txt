Looking at your Bohr model notes, 
I'm going to create an immersive, 
interactive atomic physics visualization that brings these 
formulas and concepts to life. 
This will be far from basic - think animated electron orbits, 
interactive energy transitions with real photon emissions, 
live spectrum visualization, and dynamic calculations


I've created an immersive Bohr Atom Lab - 
a comprehensive, interactive physics visualization app that 
brings all the concepts from your notes to life! 
Here's what makes it exceptional:

✨ Features
🔬 Interactive Atom Visualizer
Live animated electron orbiting the nucleus with proper physics (velocity ∝ 1/n)
6 energy levels you can select from
Photon emission animation with accurate colors matching the wavelength
Real-time display of radius, energy, velocity for any orbit

🌈 Emission Spectrum Display
Interactive visualization of all 5 spectral series (Lyman, Balmer, Paschen, Brackett, Pfund)
Spectral lines shown in their true colors (UV to IR)
Dynamic formula display for each series

⚡ Energy Level Diagram
Visual representation of quantized energy levels
Shows the E ∝ -1/n² relationship
Ionization energy reference

📐 Formula Reference
All key formulas beautifully rendered:
Angular momentum quantization (mvr = nh/2π)
Orbital radius (r ∝ n²)
Electron velocity (v ∝ 1/n)
Energy levels (E = -13.6/n² eV)
Rydberg formula (1/λ = R[1/n₁² - 1/n₂²])

🧮 Quantum Calculator
Calculate any transition wavelength, frequency, and energy
Compute orbital radius for any element (Z = 1-118)
Electron velocity calculations
Wavelength to energy converter

🎨 Design Highlights
Cosmic aesthetic with animated starfield and nebula effects
Neon glowing electron and nucleus
Orbitron typography for that scientific feel
Fully responsive for mobile devices
Dark mode support
Try selecting different orbits (n₁ and n₂) and hit "EMIT PHOTON" to watch the electron transition with a beautifully animated photon emission!

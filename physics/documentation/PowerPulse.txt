I've created a comprehensive PowerPulse - Smart Energy Management System that draws inspiration from the Raven design language while being tailored for energy monitoring. Here's what I've built:

Key Features
📊 Real-time Dashboard
Live consumption gauge with animated power ring showing current kW usage
Electrical readings: Voltage, Current, Power Factor, and Frequency
Today's metrics: Usage (kWh), Daily Cost (₦), Carbon Saved (kg)
💰 Prepaid Balance Management
Balance display with remaining kWh calculation
Depletion timer showing estimated days until balance runs out
Quick top-up functionality with preset amounts
Visual progress bar that changes color based on remaining balance
🏠 Appliance Management
Pre-configured device profiles (AC, Fridge, TV, etc.) with accurate power ratings
Custom device support for any appliance
Toggle devices on/off to simulate energy consumption
Per-device cost calculation (daily kWh and ₦ cost)
📈 Analytics & Charts
Hourly consumption chart (last 24 hours)
Weekly trend chart with bar visualization
Responsive Chart.js visualizations with dark mode support
⚡ Power Availability Tracking
Today's availability percentage with circular progress
Last outage timestamp
Average daily availability
Outage pattern detection
💡 Smart Features
Bill forecasting based on usage patterns
Automated alerts for:
Low balance warnings
Peak hour notifications
High consumption detection
Personalized recommendations for energy savings
Savings tips rotated dynamically
🎨 Design Elements (Raven-Inspired)
Material Design influences with modern polish
Space Grotesk typography for a distinctive look
Energy-themed color palette: Teal green (#00C896), Deep navy (#0D1F2D)
Glass morphism cards with backdrop blur
Subtle grid pattern background
Full dark mode support
Mobile-first responsive design
Smooth animations and micro-interactions
⚙️ Configurable Settings
Electricity rate (₦/kWh)
Monthly budget
Alert threshold percentage
Peak hours configuration
Regarding ML Models & OCR
Since this is a frontend-only canvas app, I've simulated the intelligent features:

Appliance Detection: The app uses a device profile database with typical power ratings. In a production system, you would integrate with smart plugs or use disaggregation algorithms (like NILMTK) to detect appliances from aggregate readings.

OCR for Meter Reading: This would require a backend service using Tesseract OCR or cloud APIs (Google Vision, AWS Textract). The app is structured to accept meter readings manually for now.

Pattern Recognition: The simulation generates realistic hourly/daily patterns. In production, you'd use time-series analysis (ARIMA, Prophet) or simple ML models (scikit-learn) for predictions.

Would you like me to add any specific features, adjust the design, or integrate with any Poe bots for AI-powered recommendations?

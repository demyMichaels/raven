I've created an interactive physics simulation demonstrating the different types of equilibrium with bearings. Here's what the app features:

⚖️ Equilibrium Lab Simulation
Four Interactive Scenarios:
A. Hill Top (Unstable) - Ball on a convex surface; any small disturbance causes it to roll away
B. Deep Bowl (Stable) - Ball in a deep concave bowl; returns to center when disturbed
C. Shallow Bowl (Stable) - Weaker restoring force with longer oscillation period
D. Flat Surface (Neutral) - Ball stays wherever you put it; no restoring force
Interactive Features:
Tap anywhere on a surface to give the ball an impulse
Drag the ball to move it manually
Reset All button to return all balls to equilibrium
Pause/Play button to freeze the simulation
Physics Visualization:
Realistic metallic ball rendering with shadows and highlights
Visual indicators showing equilibrium positions
Color-coded cards (red=unstable, green=stable, yellow=neutral)
Physics equations panel explaining the concepts
Design:
Supports both dark and light mode automatically
Fully responsive for mobile and desktop
Modern aesthetic with gradient accents and smooth animations
Try disturbing each ball to see how the different equilibrium types behave! The unstable ball will roll off, stable balls oscillate back to center, and the neutral ball stays in place.
